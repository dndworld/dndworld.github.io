## Black Market

Wondering if you can afford a magical item? Check prices using our [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Black Market"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166Do3cLcg_NYRZqSaAN34LQxY9C5xda5WDb9kYezJMM/) document.

The Black Market offers a means of purchasing and selling magic items. The document above details how to make transactions with the Black market. Additionally, the Black Market Bin lists all the magic items available to be purchased or sold from the Black Market Bin, without needing to submit a form to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#black-market-registry"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/742720804525178900).

For transactions through the Black Market Bin: 
- Once you've found the item you wish to purchase or sell, along with its associated costs, use the `!transaction` command in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#transaction-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531011819095982081) with all the pertinent information in the command. 
- If you're purchasing an item, fill out the form below as well and send it in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#transaction-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531011819095982081).
- Afterwards, react to it with the 🎐 `:windchime:` emoji. 

!!!Note
- Not all items can be purchased from the Black Market. 
- You cannot sell an item for both Black Marks and Gold. You must choose to trade for either one or the other. 
- You cannot sell consumables to the Market.

### Etiquette

*Please follow these guidelines, or your request will be denied:*
- **Each player may only have one unresolved registry at a time.**
- **Registries may be edited until a shopkeeper reacts with <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-pending.webp"> on it. Afterwards, the registry may no longer be edited.**
- Use the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Black Market Bin"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166Do3cLcg_NYRZqSaAN34LQxY9C5xda5WDb9kYezJMM/) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#figaros-reflavor-shop"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/555548772545855508) when applicable.
- List the items you are trading with clearly. Any homebrew items traded in should be linked or spelled out.
 - **Consumables are unable to be traded.**
- You may make thematic requests/give direction on what you would like the item to do, but specific mechanical changes, values and stat blocks are not possible.
- Ensure you have substantial amounts of gold, Black Marks and/or valuable items that can be traded. Uncommons start at several hundred gp. See the Black Market Bin for reference.
- Be clear with your request, don’t make the Shopkeeper guess what you want.
  - Bad: Looking for a custom item that fits my character’s class
  - Better: Looking for a shield that offers some mobility options
  - Best: Looking for a flail that is effective against undead

### Note on Upgrades

- All item upgrades improve its rarity by at least one Tier. (e.g. Uncommon to Rare)
- Upgrades to existing magic items are on a case-by-case basis. It may be incredibly costly if not impossible due to an item's design and/or limitation of a single attunement slot.

### Items/Services Not Obtainable through Registry

- Homebrew cursed items
- Upgrades within the same rarity (e.g. upgrading an Uncommon to a better Uncommon)
- Changing an official item’s “body slot” (e.g. a helmet cannot be turned into a ring)
- Legendary items, including upgrades from Very Rare items
- Tomes, Manuals, or other items that permanently increase ability scores.
- Certain official items, at shopkeeper's discretion
- Combining attuned items
