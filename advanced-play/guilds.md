## [Guild Rules](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8sVmnksKwb9MX98f7Z6lfmdDgfxft85JPaQKejxXj0)

- Joining a guild: You can see the list of available guilds under the GUILDS category. The guilds are player managed, and the requirements of joining a guild vary. Some guilds require members to be over a certain level threshold, or be of a certain class. Check their pinned messages for such requirements or inquire with their leader if they don't specify any.
- All guilds created must be based in Snowhaven and cannot be branches of other guilds.
- When you submit a new guild in ⁠guild-registry, react to your proposal with 🏢 (`:office:`).

## Guild Registry

See [Tax Registration Log](/advanced-play/tax-registration-log/) for guild taxes.

### Guild Member
The player that is joining a guild must log the following form. If the player is leaving, the the guild can log the form instead. A pending application can be cancelled by `~~crossing out~~` (registration fee, if applicable, is not refunded).

**On the approval date**, react to the Guild Member Form message with 🔑 🔑 to beam it to a task list for staff, and the role will be given or taken away manually by a staff member.
- Please note, in order to lighten the load on our staff members, keeping track of the seven days is left as the guild members' responsibility. For this reason, the role is likely to not be granted or removed if the message gets beamed before the approval date. You do not have to be the sender of the original message to react with 🔑 `:key:`.
