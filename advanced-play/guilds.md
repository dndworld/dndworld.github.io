## Guild Rules

- Want to start a guild? Read our [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Guild Rules"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8sVmnksKwb9MX98f7Z6lfmdDgfxft85JPaQKejxXj0/) document.

- Joining a guild: You can see the list of available guilds under the GUILDS category. The guilds are player managed, and the requirements of joining a guild vary. Some guilds require members to be over a certain level threshold, or be of a certain class. Check their pinned messages for such requirements or inquire with their leader if they don't specify any.
- All guilds created must be based in Snowhaven and cannot be branches of other guilds.
- When you submit a new guild in ⁠[!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#guild-registry"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/729487863242031288), react to your proposal with 🏢 (`:office:`).

## Guild Registry

### Guild Member
The player (or guild) must log this form, with the guild's permission if joining. If the player is leaving, the guild can log the form instead. A pending application can be cancelled by `~~crossing out~~` (registration fee, if applicable, is not refunded).

**On the approval date**, seven days after sumbission date, to update your guild roles, react to the form with 🔑 `:key:` to notify a staff member. You do not have to be the original sender to react.
- Please note, in order to lighten the load on our staff members, the timekeeping is left to guild members, so roles may not be updated if beamed before the approval date.
