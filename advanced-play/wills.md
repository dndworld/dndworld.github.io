# Wills
You may write wills dedicating equipment, property, and wealth to someone else (the beneficiary) in the event your character (the testator) dies, under certain conditions:

- The will must be written and logged here before the time of the testator's death
- The will must be RPed being written in any of the Snowhaven IC channels before the testator's death
- The will is not valid if the testator's body is not retrieved. Check with your DM if you are unsure of location.
- The will is not valid for deaths caused by retirement
- The will is not valid if either party leaves the server
- The will must follow the logging template. Incomplete wills are invalid.
- The testator must have been close with the beneficiary IC
- For magic items, [rules for Ownership Transfer](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/569731521951563776/937751438979919904) apply

You may write wills for all your characters if you so wish, and amend them at any point in time.
