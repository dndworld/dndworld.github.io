- The will must be written and logged in the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Wills Log"](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/535499069993517057)
 before the time of the testator's death
- The will must be RPed being written in any of the Snowhaven IC channels before the testator's death
- The will is not valid if the testator's body is not retrieved. Check with your DM if you are unsure of location.
- The will is not valid for deaths caused by retirement
- The will is not valid if either party leaves the server
- The will must follow the logging template. Incomplete wills are invalid.
- The testator must have been close with the beneficiary IC
