# Pets and Mounts

Thinking about owning a friendly companion? View our [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Pets and Mounts"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpK9WUF73NqAP1YpqshIwdlbz8_hGGs36nvghEMQ1MA/) document.

## Companion Rules
1. Companions (pets and mounts) must be purchased. Unless your character‚Äôs background grants a companion, your PC cannot have companions without paying. You cannot invent companions in RP channels or steal them during games. You may also flavor the transaction in one of the alternative ways:
  - The companion was adopted and the cost is from buying supplies.
  - The companion traveled with your character before they became an adventurer. E.g. you can have a childhood pet even if the purchase was technically made while in Snowhaven.
  - You may approach `@FanMail` for alternative ways of flavoring meeting your companion.
2. Mounts have additional weekly upkeep costs as indicated in the table below. Nonpayment of upkeep may result in mounts being removed. The only exceptions are if you:
  - Are not currently paying for lifestyle.
  - Have a house with the Stables module.
  - Are in a guild with the Stables module.
  - Are in a guild with the Home to Animals benefit.
  - Were on hiatus.
  - The mount was summoned.
3. Pets do not have mechanical benefits and cannot be taken on games.
4. A character can have one pet by default, and can have multiple companions if they have space to house them, such as by living in a house or guild with sufficient slots. E.g., if you have a house without the Pet House module, you can only house four additional Small or smaller pets; a Stable module would be needed to house mounts.
5. If a companion is not stated in the above document, they are not available for purchase.
