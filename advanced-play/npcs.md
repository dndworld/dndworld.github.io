# NPC Encounters

NPC registries is a unique system which allows you to schedule encounters with NPCs. These roleplay-only sessions are run by our team of NPC Masters, and last around 1-2 hours each. Encounters with celestials, fiends or higher entities in general are known as prayers, and are handled by the more specialized Temple Speakers.


## General Guidelines

- Fill in all availabilities in EST

- You can only schedule an appointment with one NPC per log

- Do not make another log until the one in queue has been resolved.

- Once you have successfully gone through with your appointment, you can only make another appointment after 24 hours.

- Avoid making time urgent logs as staff are volunteers and cannot guarantee that they may be handled in time.

- Regular NPC Encounters (non-deity) do not have a DC and you do not need to RP booking the appointment. Temple/Shrine encounters have a DC your Religion roll has to meet as stated in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#pantheon"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/535362293144223744), and the prayer must be roleplayed.

- These encounters are designed solely for immersion. Please don't log an encounter with the intention of asking for favors or magical items.

- Logs that are not resolved within 1 year due to player inactivity or general scheduling impossibilities are automatically removed.

## Temple & Shrine Encounters

### Praying

- **You must RP your prayer in ‚Å†[!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#temple-to-the-gods"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542431801394855936), [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#shrines-to-the-gods"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/538134079288377344) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#cultists-shrine"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/586365517749813258) before rolling.**
- Refer to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#pantheon"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/535362293144223744) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#hell-inc"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/640104532042317834) for the Religion Check DCs you must meet for each entity
- If you get a Nat 1 or a negative, log it as well.
  - Nat 1s/negatives may result in catching the attention of another NPC. Vice versa, a Nat 20 might result in the appearance of more than one entity.
- A successful Divine Intervention automatically counts as a successful Religion check.
- If your prayer has failed to catch the attention of any entity, you **do not** need to log it. This happens when your roll
  - does not meet the DC or higher
  - is not a Nat 1
  - is not a negative result

- **For celestials, don't log for petty matters including**:
  - Asking for blessings
  - Asking for protection
  - Criticism of a god
  - Something out of their domain
  - Questions that can be answered by a priest or found in the library
  - etc.

!!!
On the contrary, fiends and devils are happy to answer the above, in exchange for a deal of course.
!!!

- If you have successfully met the DC, do not make another prayer until that one has been resolved.
- In the event that you fail, you can only retry your prayer after 48 hours have passed.
- You can only pray to **one** deity at any time
- This system only works in the temple/shrine channels, unless otherwise specified.
<br><br>
- If someone else uses the Help action for a prayer, only one person should roll and log, but they can make their roll at an advantage. Note this in the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#npc-registry"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/545107769951518740) form

!!!
If there is no valid prayer to a specific god *prior to the check being made*, the prayer will not be answered.

In addition, please do not pray for a god/devil to give the PC a specific purpose or something in particular for them to do - Temple Speakers cannot create personal quests for players to carry out. 

If there is something you have in mind - such as using the prayer to RP a multiclass in-character or as flavor for leveling/gaining features - that is very welcome; please put that in the notes. However, creating individualized tasks for PCs is outside the scope of the server.

## During Encounters

- Refrain from interrupting scheduled appointments where characters are talking to NPCs. Ask for permission OOC first.
- You are not allowed to pray to another deity while interacting with one
- While NPC encounters do not count as DM events and hence are not eligible to claim RPXP to your xp tracker, you can still gain RPXP as if you were RPing.

!!!
Once you have successfully completed your encounter, you can only make another registry after 24 hours.
