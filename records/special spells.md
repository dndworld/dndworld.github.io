# Special Spells

Some spells produce effects that last over a period of time or majorly impact the world, such as Magnificent Mansion, Magic Mouth, Teleportation Circle, etc. A select number of these spells can be used in RP channels as long as they’re logged in [#spell-effects-log](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/579612493345980447), while others can only be cast while in games. As long as the spell has an effect duration of 24 hours or more, it should be logged.

Please note that the casting of these spells must still obey server PVP rules and not affect the general population. Misuse of spells, especially to harm other PCs/NPCs, will not be tolerated and will be retconned. Note that just because an NPC Master or Mod does not immediately step in to retcon it, does not mean that such instances will not be eventually reported and retconned.

### Spells Requiring Repeated Castings (e.g. Teleportation Circle)

- You need to post once per week that the spell is being cast daily. This can be done in a thread created from the original post.
- If you participate in a game that involves leaving Snowhaven for more than a day and the spell requires being cast in the same location daily, then the effect fades and you will need to start over with a new log. It is up to you to check with the DM whether or not this will be the case.
- You may post a log during questlock if the game takes place over less than one in-game day.
- Using a spell slot reserved for daily casting in a game is considered cheating, and may be punished.
- If you go on hiatus, your character is treated as continuing to cast any relevant spells, as long as they are not roleplayed as having left Snowhaven.

### Casting Spells from Items

Spells cast from magic items that store spells such as Ring of Spell Storing and Spell Gems must also be logged.


Below is a non-exhaustive list of common spells that should be logged here as well as applicable changes to fit the server. If unsure, enquire in [`#rulings-questions`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828)

### Mounts and Familiars

*Casting must specify what form the summon takes. Spells must be recast if the form is changed.*
- Find Familiar
- Find Greater Steed

### Transportation outside Snowhaven

- Teleportation circle (5th): Sigils for other locations can only be learnt while in games. For the two sequences, they would know one to the Snowhaven temple, and one other location of your choice.
- Transport via plants (6th)
