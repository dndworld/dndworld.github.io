# Character Death

All characters who die on the server are immortalized in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#list-of-the-fallen"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/544159624790671391). You may either write a post in memory of the character, or to make the grieving process easier, you may react to the character's last moment with a :diya_lamp: `:diya_lamp:` for the post to be beamed to the channel.

### What do I do now?

Your character's friends or acquaintances may start a fund for a revival. In which case, you can wait as long as it is necessary for the fund to be raised. During this time you cannot RP your character, and the character slot is still being used.

In case that is not an option, or you wish to rather start over with an entirely different character, not all of the player's efforts are lost, as you may benefit from the Cushion Rule. Please beware, once you use the cushion rule, the old character can no longer be revived.

## Cushion Rule

Upon the death or retirement of your character, you may choose to start the next character at a higher level than 1, following the table below. They may also gain magical items and wealth, determined by the table below. If you wish to start at a lower level than offered by the Cushion Rule, you are free to do so.

Please note, the cushioned characters are not valid until the claim is processed. You cannot RP or sign up to DM events with the character with a pending cushion claim.
