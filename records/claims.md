# Claims

## RPXP Claims

If it has been 1 month since your character's last DM-sanctioned event, or since you imported your character, you can add all your RPXP to your main XP counter. 

1. Run the following command in `#xp-tracker` and grab the message link.
```
!rpxp xp
```

2. Fill in the form and post in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#claims-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/848389898204741642)

- The 1-month timer resets once the claim is **processed**.
- If your RPXP changed after you posted the form, you may update the claim with the new value and new link to the `!rpxp xp` output.

```
**RPXP Claim**
Character Name:
Character‚Äôs Last DM Event:
Character's Last RPXP Claim (if applicable):
RPXP:
Link to the latest `!rpxp xp` output in #xp-tracker:
Link to Sheet: <link in the bracket>
```

3) Wait for the approval. You will be pinged in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-records-discussion"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/551968957423419413)

- Once your RPXP claim has been approved, you must add it **immediately** in `#xp-tracker`.

## Reaching Level 20
- When your character reaches Level 20, you have the option to retire them and benefit from the Cushion rule, or Legacy your character and make a new Level 1 PC.
- If you choose to retire your character, your new character can start at Level 10 or below, with magic items decided by the [Cushion rule](/records/character-death/#cushion-rule) above.
- If you choose not to retire your character, your Level 20 character becomes a Legacy slot, and you free up a slot to create a new Level 1 character.
  - Legacy characters can continue to participate in games, roleplay, DTD, etc.
  - Legacy slots are special and do not count towards your slot total. Hence, if you later retire your Level 20 character, you cannot make another character or benefit from the Cushion rule. In order to claim your new Level 1 PC, you must submit the form below for approval.
- Both choices are open to you until you make a decision, if you choose to make a new character at all. There is no time limit.
- Please note: Once a character has been retired, it cannot then be unretired without the use of a Special Request.

Fill in the below template and wait for approval to claim your benefits. Please note that once you submit this form, you cannot create another new character if you subsequently retire your Level 20 character.
