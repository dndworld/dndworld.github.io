## How to Navigate Discord More Quickly

For **desktop**: `Ctrl`+`K` (or `âŒ˜`+`K` for Mac). (This is called the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Quick Switcher"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000070311-Quick-Switcher))

For **mobile**:
- Go to You > Settings (:icon-gear:, top-right) -> :icon-gear: Advanced
- Toggle one of the LaunchPad options
- Pull Tab is recommended. This is added to the right side for you to swipe left on

Both features work the same way: Once open, you can use it to quickly search a channel by name or go back to a recently-visited channel.

### How to Check Who Mentioned (@) You
For **desktop**, read [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045027712-Inbox-FAQ).

For **mobile**, start from the channel list, then tap on the `Notifications` icon, in the bottom-center. 

### How to Mute Channels
Follow [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this article"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/209791877-How-do-I-selectively-disable-notifications-for-specific-servers).

For **mobile**, tap the channel name at the top of the screen (to the member list) to see the bell icon mentioned above.

## User Input

### How to Change Your Server Nickname
Follow [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this article"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/219070107-Server-Nicknames), but skip the IN THE MEMBER'S LIST section (it's hard to pull off here).

For **mobile**, to follow the WITHIN THE TEXT CHANNEL section, tap (instead of right-clicking) your username to find the Edit Server Profile option.

### How to Format Text on Discord
You can use Markdown to format your Discord messages! Read more about it [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline).

When formatting roleplay posts, follow [Roleplay Rules 7](/rp-rules/).

### How to Add Reactions to Discord Messages
Follow [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this article"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041139231-Adding-Emojis#h_01H06HNQ7TP5MDCDRJVG52QFVN) (It should open to the relevant section).

For **mobile**, long-tap on the message to find the plus smiley-face icon mentioned above.

## Server History

### How to Search For a Discord Message
Follow [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this article"](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000468588-Using-Search).

Common searches:
> - **To find your stat/gold rolls**: `in:#official-character-rolls mentions:YourUsername` (replace `YourUsername`)
> - **To find a character's transactions**:  `in:#transaction-log <character name>` (replace `<character name>`, incl. `<>`)

### How to Link a Discord Message
Follow [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="this article"](https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/), but look for the `Copy Message Link` option, not the `Copy ID` option.

- React to your own question if it got buried in the FAQ section (For example, if questions below yours have already been answered AND it has been at least 10 minutes since the last staff activity in that channel).

- React to another member's question that is in a **non**-FAQ channel
