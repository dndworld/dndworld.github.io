## Introduction

You’ve clicked on an ad for Dnd World and are now on the server. Great! However, if you’ve never been on a large server, your first reaction is probably “wow, there are a lot of channels here” Not to fear, this guide is made specifically for those of you who have only been in friend group servers with a couple of channels, or otherwise smaller West Marches servers.

## Channels

Due to the complexity of D&D, the age of the server, and the general number of rulings that have been made to standardize procedures across the server, there are a lot of channels. Most channels will be necessary at one point, but you can (and should) only read those that are relevant to you as you progress through the server. This means if you are just getting started on the server, you should just read the Welcome and Getting Started category.

Channels are sorted into categories for easier navigation. As a rule of thumb, you should start from the top before going below, as they are roughly arranged in order of what you should read. [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#channel-guide"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506745916850176) is your best friend, as it has an overview of all the channels in the server.

## Etiquette

### Pinging

In general, pinging someone, unless there is an urgency regarding the ping or you are explicitly given permission to, is considered bad manners. This is because for large servers, if people just pinged each other willy nilly, their mentions would get spammed. Most people do not enjoy being disturbed by things that are not urgent. Your best bet is to be patient and wait for them to come online and reply. 

Of course, if their status/about me says pings welcome, you can go ahead and ping them. If you become close to someone, you can ask them if they are ok with being pinged. Some people may give you explicit permission then.

If you repeatedly ping people unnecessarily without permission, you may receive a warning.

### When Staff Ping You
Staff may ping you in an official capacity when something directly concerns you. You are expected to respond or acknowledge as instructed. Here are some examples:

- DMs will ping you when you are accepted to a game
  - You should react to the acceptance post using the corresponding emoji as indicated by the DM
  - Failure to react before the start of the game may result in your position being revoked
  - You should also respond to the roll call when the game starts so that the DM knows you are there
- Mods will ping you to issue Demerit Points or warnings for offenses. You should respond politely and respectfully:
  - Refrain from one word answers (e.g. “ok” or “whatever”)
  - Do not use a passive aggressive tone
  - Do not personally attack the mod or staff or otherwise imply they are targeting you
    - No one mod is responsible for handing out warnings
  - Do not contest the existence of a rule
    - Rules are there to cultivate an environment we want, and have historical context due to past incidents behind them.
  - If you would like to appeal the ruling, please message `@FanMail` so as not to clog the channel.
- NPC Masters will ping you when they have time to run your encounter
  - Respond by letting them know whether or not you are available
  - Please note if you do not respond your encounter may be skipped or deleted

### Role Pinging

Role pinging (such as `@DM` or `@NPC Master`) in general is a rule violation, due to the reason above. The only exception is a Mod ping, and only during time sensitive situations. 

Some examples when you should ping Mod include:

- Argument getting heated
- Player vs Player (PvP) fight about to happen
- Bot raid (if they have not been notified yet)
- Unpleasant person interrupting game
- When someone is about to do non-PG things (both OOC and IC)

Some examples when you should not ping Mod include:

- When you want to ask a question
  - Please direct questions to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#beginner-help"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/621035485690724369) and patiently wait for a reply. If it gets buried, you can :bell: react to your question to escalate it.
- When you want to make a non-urgent report
  - Please react with an :exclamation: to the offending post, or if a series of posts, screenshot it and send to `@FanMail` 
- When its a bot raid and someone else has already pinged them
- When you want to make a complaint
  - Please direct complaints to `@FanMail` 
- When your log hasn’t been processed
  - Staff process logs on a volunteer basis. Please be patient and wait for them to process it, and only comment in the corresponding discussion channel if you feel like it has been buried.

#### Never Ping `@everyone`!

This ping is turned off but you should nonetheless not try it. On smaller servers, this might be ok as it will only notify a small number of people, but for a server as large as ours it is disastrous. Regardless if the ping is well meaning, we may assume you are hacked and may take steps against you, such as a ban.

### PMing

PMing or Private Messaging someone without permission, for reasons similar to pinging, is considered bad manners. 

There are a few exceptions:
- You are a new member and need help from a Welcomer
- You have a report about an upper staff (Assistant and above) and need a Mod to keep it confidential

Otherwise, it is frowned upon, for several reasons:
- People may not enjoy being disturbed, as PMing automatically sets off a notification
- Scams are common in PMs. If they do not know you, they might ignore you to be safe.
- PMing puts them on a spot, whereas in a channel they can get help from other people to answer your question
- PMs are hard to track and can be taken out of context. To prevent misunderstandings, they may prefer to discuss in a public channel

Dnd World has multiple avenues for you to reach personnel. Here are some examples:
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#bounty-discussion"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/536011720553136138) for DMs
  - Here you can ask clarifications about games with DMs, notify them if you delete your signup, or let them know if you are unable to make it for a game.
- `@FanMail` bot for Mods
  - The FanMail bot is located on the right hand member sidebar, near the top under “Display Bots”
  - You can send reports or grievances to them here
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#homebrew-discussion"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/559419826767134730) for Homebrewers
  - Here you can ask clarifications regarding usage of server homebrew
- RP ooc channels for Events Committee
  - Usually this means whichever corresponding OOC for the channel the event is being held in.
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#shop-ooc"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/543401501633282068) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#snowhaven-south-ooc"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/621085113706348564) for NPC Masters
  - Usually NPC Masters will ping you first when it is your turn.
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#dtd-ls-discussion"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/586697587932004362) for Thralls
  - Here you can ask questions about how to do lifestyle or DTDs
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584) for staff in general
  - Here you can ask questions that do not fit in the other channels

It should be noted that asking questions in different channels will usually result in you being redirected to the proper channel or your question being buried. This is not because you are being ignored; channels are simply made for organization, and different staff monitor different channels so that they can be better equipped to answer your question.

#### When Staff PM you

Staff may ping you in an official capacity when something directly concerns you. You are expected to respond or acknowledge as instructed. Here are some examples:

- DMs might PM you to ask secret questions pertaining to a bounty
- Mods might PM you when relating to an ongoing investigation
- Assistants might PM you to move your characters in a DDB link
- NPC Masters might PM you to seek further details regarding your character
- Welcomers might PM you to assist with making your character

## Differences From Smaller Servers/Campaigns

### Games Are Not On Demand

Some servers might allow players to request games when they want them, such as pinging a role or putting a request in a channel. This is not available on our server and asking for games is considered bad manners. This is for several reasons:

- With so many people in the server, it becomes spam
- DMs run games as a hobby when they want to. This puts pressure on them to churn out games and ruins their enjoyment of the game
- Games take time and energy, and availability varies from person to person
- It comes across as unappreciative, especially with the effort DMs put into their games
- Games take time and energy, and this varies from person to person
- Just because you aren’t able to attend a game does not mean games aren’t being held
- Not considering our server, for regular campaigns, most games are usually held max once a week, with a steady trend towards biweekly and once a month due to the state of the world. This trend should let you know how unavailable people generally are.
- Above all, it is out of our control. We cannot simply force DMs to run more games. We are not willing to lower our standards for staff entry so we can have the short term benefit of more games and sacrifice the long term benefits of quality control.

### Backstory is Mostly for Player to Player Roleplay.

This is less of a breach of etiquette and more of managing expectations. In a regular campaign or a smaller server, your DM might integrate your backstory into the world. However, due to the West Marches rotational DM style, as well as the sheer number of players, this is unfeasible on the server. 

You can still write a backstory, and you are encouraged to in order to give your character more depth. It will simply be for inter-player roleplay opportunities. 

### The World Stays Mostly Consistent

Depending on the bounty content, your character can save the world from a powerful lich or stop a dragon from terrorizing villagers. This is not what this is referring to. This is referring to those who might want to overthrow the Senate within Snowhaven, or become a demigod. 

In general, achieving personal character goals that involve changing the setting is very rare. This is related to the point above about backstory. In addition, a part of the appeal of the server is the drop in and out style, and that relies on keeping the setting relatively consistent. 

### Game Plots are Self Contained

Occasionally, there will be interlinked story content, and those will be posted in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#world-events"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/586916342712631317). However, these function more like arcs and less like major overarching story plot. This is because the server is designed to have consistent play, and having an end goal defeats the purpose of the server.

### Different Playstyles

In a regular campaign or small server, the DM might interview players to ensure all players have similar playstyles. On this server however, we accept people from many backgrounds in order to be as accommodating as possible. This means you will have to make compromises when it comes to playing with other people with different styles from you.

In general, if you find that you do not mesh well with a certain player or character, you can either talk out these concerns with that player, or simply avoid them. However, if you feel like a rule has been breached or a line has been crossed, you should file a report to the `@FanMail` bot and we will investigate accordingly.

### Staff Hierarchy

Dnd World functions on a linear staff hierarchy. This means that almost every staff member has a limit on what they can do. Please address your concerns to the correct channels (see section on PMing) so that they can be addressed.
Don’t complain to staff in public channels, especially lower ranking staff like Bookkeeping Assistants. They can’t enact changes to the system. Submit complaints to `@FanMail`. 
Don’t ping or PM admins. See sections about them above.
DMs, while being the main arbiter during games, are subject to guidelines by Mentors and Seniors. So don’t take it out on them if you are not satisfied with xp or gold given.

### Changes Take Time

Even if you submit a reasonable suggestion in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-suggestions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506014883217419), it may still take time to implement. Usually this can take 3 months, maybe even half a year. This is because we are often already working on a lot of projects, and have to prioritize. Suggestions need to be processed, meetings need to be deliberated over, and someone needs to sit down and make things happen. These factors make project developments take a long time.

### There is Much More to Do Outside Games

Unlike campaigns, when you can only play when games are happening, there are all sorts of activities that you can do to further your experience. In fact, we encourage you to explore all the server has to offer, in order to avoid feeling bored waiting for games. Here are just some things you can do:

- Chat in OOC channels
- Roleplay with other characters
- Do DTD
- Join guilds
- Request NPC encounters

## Conclusion

So there you have it! This will hopefully help manage your expectations towards the server and help you assimilate into our culture better. If you have suggestions on what else we should include, please feel free to suggest in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-suggestions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506014883217419) or send a `@FanMail`.
