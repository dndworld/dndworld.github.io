## Introduction

So you’ve been thinking about joining staff. Great! We are always welcome to have more staff join our team. In fact, joining staff is one of the best ways you can help us! After all, we’re always in need of more hands for implementing changes, helping players and increasing activity, all while helping as well yourself by increasing the server’s quality of life!

However, we do our best to make sure applicants are a good fit, and that might mean delaying or rejecting an application that we feel need more time. We like to make sure all staff are productive additions to our team and bring a positive attitude. That being said, this document is designed to give you a more in-depth overview of the various staff roles so that you can pick the one that suits you best. It also gives you tips on how to write your application so that you don’t undersell yourself.

## Minimum Criteria

This criteria is what we look out for when vetting for all staff role applications. There are some exceptions to this criteria depending on the role you are applying for. If you aren’t sure, you can go ahead and apply, but be warned that these exceptions are quite rare.

- At least **one month** since last application
- No recent Demerit Points
    - Having no DPs at all is an advantage, but we take into account context and the role applied.
- No lesser courthouses **relevant to the role applied for**
    - E.g. If you are applying for Bookkeeping Assistant and were recently lessered for DTD mistakes, we may decline the application on the basis of needing better familiarity.
- No demonstration of hostile or passive aggressive attitude
- Not removed from staff before due to poor performance
- Sufficient recent activity
- Has not submitted a denied application recently 

## Tips on Writing Your Application

### Attention to Detail

This may seem obvious, but your application is judged for the amount of care you put into it. Here are some simple errors to avoid making so that your application isn’t rejected right off the bat.

- Spelling/Grammatical Errors
    - Especially for role names, staff names, and lore-related names
- Using the wrong application format
    - For staff, please use the one in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#staff-guide"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/684503404000706649)
- Not using the application form at all
    - If you send a FanMail saying “I’d like to apply for staff!” you will be directed to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#staff-roles"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/877373177381126144)
- Not filling out all fields in an application

### Length

Try to give us as many relevant details as you can, but don’t overdo it. Avoid giving one liners as this does not really tell us much about you and can make it seem like you didn’t put much effort into it. If you do not have experience, try to talk about why you are passionate about helping, or what you plan to do if given the role. 

Please note: We get a lot of applications for DM roles that list home campaigns as relevant experience. While this can be useful, we are more interested in knowing the “soft” skills you learned from DMing. This is because traditional campaigns are very different from West Marches, and can vary in quality. Tell us about how you might have learned to resolve conflict at the table, or when a game went badly and how you grew from that experience. 

### What We Look For

- Assisting newbies (e.g. reviewing sheets), whether in PMs, OOC channels, or IC channels
- Helpful during games, e.g. answering questions in OOC, linking the correct commands, etc.
- How you treat staff, e.g. how you treat DMs when you aren't picked for a game, , how you treat people when things don't go your way.
- How you treat fellow players, e.g. how you 
- How you react when you've made a mistake


### Misc. Tips

- Don’t spam applications
    - Do not send more applications if you have not received a response
    - Consistently applying to multiple roles is a surefire way to get your app rejected. We want people who are passionate about their role and not just wanting to be staff for the power.
- Don’t harass staff about the status of your application, especially in public
    - Staff often need time to consider an application, especially if the review committee is busy that week. 
- Don’t try to guilt trip staff about your application
    - No one staff member is responsible for the result of your application. Most applications are reviewed by a committee.

## Rating System

The overview of the roles below will be based on 6 criteria. This is a subjective opinion and may not be representative of your experience; however, they are general enough to provide you an idea of what to expect.

The 6 criteria are:

    - A score of 1 means that you will never need to work with the public, while a score of 5 means that you need to consider your responses very carefully.
- **Initiative**
    - This refers to the amount of proactiveness you need to have in order to perform your job to its maximum
