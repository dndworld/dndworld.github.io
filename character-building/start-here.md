## New to D&D?
Head over to [New to D&D](new-to-dnd/), which has a step-by-step guide for making your first D&D character!

## Server Rules for Character Creation
Character creation rules can be found in [Character Creation Rules](cc-rules/).

!!!warning **Please Note: we are using the 2014 D&D 5e ruleset.**
If you are using D&D Beyond, these options will be marked with the `[Legacy]` tag.
!!!

## Stats/Gold/HP
It is entirely optional to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you must use the rolled results. All rolls must be made in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264) for it to be valid.

### Stats
> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.  
> - For rolling, use `!rollstats` in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264).
> 
> You are only permitted one roll per character, and the command will give you stats that are to our server's minimum standard.
> 
> !!!warning
> Do not roll stats on D&D Beyond! You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling.
> !!!
> 
> You can switch to rolling from Standard Array/Point Buy if you are still in the character creation stage.

### Gold
To roll for gold, follow the instructions [here](stat-rolling/). Please note that if you roll for gold, you cannot take equipment or gold from your class or background.

> You may take starting equipment or roll for gold. 
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the item must be available in the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Snowhaven Market document"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU/).
> 
> Once you have rolled the gold and imported your sheet in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), you may then purchase the equipment in the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#transaction-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531011819095982081).

### HP
> We recommend that you choose **fixed value HP** as described in PHB. You may choose to roll HP following the instructions pinned in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264).

## Character Sheet Options
To play on the server, your character sheet needs to be compatible with Avrae Bot. 
- The three options are: GSheet, DiceCloud or D&D Beyond (DDB).

**(Optional) How to get content sharing links on D&D Beyond**
> Thanks to the support of our patrons as well as a club account from D&D Beyond, we are able to provide you with all paid material via content sharing links if you are using D&D Beyond for your character sheet. To benefit from this, check out the [DDB Guide](ddb/) and submit the form.

## Character Options
For information on allowed/banned material as well as allowed UA and homebrew options, please have a look at [Character Creation Rules](cc-rules/).

- Your characters start at **Level 1**. 
- You are **not** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

When given options, choose following:
> - Sources: Homebrew Content, Expanded Rules, Legacy, Critical Role Content, Humblewood
> - Optional Class Features and Custom Origin are allowed (note: approved materials only).
> - Select **Milestone**, not XP. This is because we use a slightly different XP progression, which is managed within the server through Avrae.
> - Carrying capacity: Use Encumbrance
> - Ignore coin weight: Off
> - Character Privacy: **Public**

## Change Your Server Nickname
Change your Server Nickname to **Name of Character (Race Class).**

> Examples:
> - Myrdin (Halfling Ranger) 
> - Panadol (Drow Warlock)

## Upload Your Character Sheet
In [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), replace the `<link>` with the link of your character sheet.

```
!import <link>
```

If you have used standard array or point buy, declare so after you upload your sheet. 
- You DO NOT need to wait for your sheet to be approved.

Once you've uploaded your sheet to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), you will be automatically granted **Newbie** and **Level 1** roles, and the rest of the server should now be visible. If for some reason the bot fails, send a message to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584), and a staff member will grant you the roles.
