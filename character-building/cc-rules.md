This page contains the rules for character creation. For the starting guide to the server, please head over to [Start Here](start-here.md).

## Start

!!!danger We use the **2014 D&D 5e ruleset**. 
 - If you are using D&D Beyond, these options will be marked with the `[Legacy]` tag.

- Your characters start at **Level 1**.
!!!

### Transferring Characters from Other Servers/Campaigns
You cannot transfer characters from other places. However, you can create a version of them in this server following the same creation process as any other new characters.

## Character Sheet Options

> You must use a sheet compatible with the **Avrae** dice bot. The following are all free to use. Your options are:
> - [**D&D Beyond**](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) (Best for new players)
> - [**GSheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtJ9AYC_BWUuvP85UqVBBscQO8DhZF8ArAdZnjUO0WM)
> - [**DiceCloud v1**](https://v1.dicecloud.com/)
> - [**DiceCloud v2**](https://dicecloud.com/)

> - DiceCloud and GSheet are better for homebrew. DiceCloud takes some learning, so it is recommended for more experienced players.
> - GSheet is the closest to a paper sheet/fillable pdf, so if you are used to those methods, you may find GSheet the easiest.
> - Mythweavers, character sheet apps, and pdfs are not compatible with Avrae.

+++ D&D Beyond
[D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)

There is also a newbie-friendly step-by-step guide in [New to D&D](new-to-dnd.md).

Character Preferences (settings)
- **Sources**: Homebrew Content, Expanded Rules, Legacy, Critical Role Content

!!!warning Not everything from these sources is allowed to be used in the server.
Please refer to the "Sources" section below for full details.
!!!

!!!
- **Dice Rolling**: Off (We use Avrae Discord bot for dice rolls)
- **Optional Features**: On
- **Advancement Type**: Milestone
- **Hit Point Type**: "Fixed" is recommended. If you choose "Manual", you **must** make the rolls in `#official-character-rolls` channel, **not** in D&D Beyond
- **Encumbrance Type**: Use Encumbrance
- **Ignore Coin Weight**: Off
- **Character Privacy**: Public
!!!

Leave the rest of the options as they are.

Once you created a character on D&D Beyond, make sure to do the following:
- Equip your weapons and armor by clicking on the box next to them in the equipment page.
- If you decide to roll for HP in `#official-character-rolls`, you will need to manually enter your HP.

### [Unearthed Arcana (UA) and Homebrew](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZysB8Jyc3LfVMKOtiQwODfT1s2oI38shuTeCnbyOSPs)

!!!
If you are new to D&D, we recommend you skip this section.
!!!

Unearthed Arcana is unofficial content released by the D&D developers for playtesting. Homebrew refers to self-published content created by our server.

> - UA that gets officially released or revisited later in another UA is banned.
> - Any UA content that hasn't been vetted for approval yet isn't allowed. Therefore, if it is not in the approved UA section, it cannot be used.
> - Charity content, planeshift content, content released by developers outside D&D Beyond, and Critical Role content is considered unofficial and only approved for use if they are in the homebrew document (i.e. the Blood Hunter class).
> - You cannot multiclass with Homebrew and UA classes/subclasses due to balance reasons.
>   - For approved third party content released on D&D Beyond, we will specify if it is eligible for multiclass e.g. Humblewood 
> - If you plan on using Homebrew or UA content, we highly recommend you to use GSheet or DiceCloud sheets due to various limitations of D&D Beyond's Homebrew system.


### [DnD World Errata/Variant Feature Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3h5AUgzscyKRJgFIDQkMuLbnl87oOfj4HUalVySXCo)

Erratas refer to changes made to the official game rules, which our server does for balance reasons and to better suit the West Marches setting. The above document along with the [Erratas and Clarifications page](/erratas.md) compile all changes to official content and variant features we've added.

## Character Creation

### Ability Scores

> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.

### HP

> At 1st level, as per RAW you take max of your hit die, determined by your class, and add your Constitution modifier.

### Rolling for Stats/HP/Gold

!!!warning
> - It is entirely **optional** to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you must use the rolled results.
> - All rolls must be made in [!badge #official-character-rolls](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264) for it to be valid. Follow the instructions pinned in the channel for rolling Stats, HP, and/or Gold. **Do not roll stats on D&D Beyond!**
> 
> - You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling. 
> - You can switch to rolling from Standard Array/Point Buy if you are still in the character creation phase.
!!!

### Character Details

**Name**
> - Your nickname, character name, as well as username must be easily pingable by the staff members and not something with over repetition of characters (e.g. Caaaaaallum), key-smashes (e.g. jahfjbqwubwqu), difficult to search (e.g. "Copy" or "Backup" as a name), use special font, etc.

**Age**
> - You are not allowed to create characters younger than adolescence, using the guidelines the below chart.
> - You also may not play a character who behaves drastically younger than their actual age, i.e. overtly childish behavior.

## Equipment

> - You may take starting equipment **__or__** roll for gold.
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the item must be available in the market. All PHB mundane items are included with the same price. 
> [Snowhaven Market Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU)
> 
> - If you choose to roll for gold, follow the instructions pinned in `#official-character-rolls`. Once you have made the roll, you must use the rolled result and you cannot take equipment or gold from your class or background.
>   - After you have rolled the gold, you may then purchase the equipment from the above document, and by logging the transactions in the `#transaction-log`. 
> 
> - You are **__not__** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

## Character Creation Phase

After you create your character and before the character attends a DM event, you may change parts of the character as many times as you want. The following rules apply:

> - You must keep all rolled results. If you have rolled the stats, you cannot switch back to Standard Array or Point Buy.
> - If you chose Standard Array or Point buy as the Ability Score generation method, you may switch to rolling for stats. Please note, once you have rolled stats, you must use them.
> - You may not switch between choosing starting equipment and rolling for gold.
> - You may not reroll stats / gold / hp.

> - If any of the starting equipment were sold and you need to switch them, retcon the transaction before doing so.
> - Keep RPXP and Experience counter values.

> - You are still in the character creation phase after gaining XP from Combat Training DTD, an approved RPXP claim, or Avrae Tutorial XP.

!!!warning 
Once your character participates in a DM event, all rebuilds must be submitted for review in `#rebuild-retire-log`, following the rules in [!badge Rebuilding](rebuild.md)
!!!

## Beyond 1st Level

### Multiclass

> You are allowed to multiclass when you level up, as long as you meet the standard stat prerequisites.

### ASI/Feat

> You are allowed to take a feat instead of taking Ability Score Improvement (ASI), when the class gives you the option at certain levels.

## Multiple Characters

> - You start with **2 character slots** on this server. You can gain extra character slots by becoming a [Patron](https://www.patreon.com/Dndworld) or taking on certain staff roles.

> - You may make your second character any time, following the same procedure as your first character. 

> - You cannot sign up for, or go on the same quest with both characters, as per [Roleplay Rules 11](/rp-rules/). 
> - If you are roleplaying more than one character at the same time, you can only gain RPXP for one of them during that period.
> 
> - Your characters cannot be in the same guild.
> - Your characters cannot benefit from each other's presence, e.g. they cannot give each other items or gold.
