This page contains the rules for character creation. For the starting guide to the server, please head over to [Start Here](start-here/).

## Start

!!!warning We use the **2014 D&D 5e ruleset**. 
 - If you are using D&D Beyond, these options will be marked with the `[Legacy]` tag.

- Your characters start at **Level 1**.
!!!

### Transferring Characters from Other Servers/Campaigns
You cannot transfer characters from other places. However, you can create a version of them in this server following the same creation process as any other new characters.

## Character Sheet Options

> You must use a sheet compatible with the **Avrae** dice bot. The following are all free to use. Your options are:
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**D&D Beyond**"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) (Best for new players)
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**GSheet**"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtJ9AYC_BWUuvP85UqVBBscQO8DhZF8ArAdZnjUO0WM/)
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**DiceCloud v1**"](https://v1.dicecloud.com/)
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**DiceCloud v2**"](https://dicecloud.com/)

> - DiceCloud and GSheet are better for homebrew. DiceCloud takes some learning, so it is recommended for more experienced players.
> - GSheet is the closest to a paper sheet/fillable pdf, so if you are used to those methods, you may find GSheet the easiest.
> - Mythweavers, character sheet apps, and pdfs are not compatible with Avrae.

+++ D&D Beyond
[!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="D&D Beyond"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)

### [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Unearthed Arcana (UA) and Homebrew"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZysB8Jyc3LfVMKOtiQwODfT1s2oI38shuTeCnbyOSPs/)

!!!warning
If you are new to D&D, we recommend you skip this section.
!!!

Unearthed Arcana is unofficial content released by the D&D developers for playtesting. Homebrew refers to self-published content created by our server.

> - UA that gets officially released or revisited later in another UA is banned.
> - Only Approved UA listed in the above document can be used.
> - Charity content, planeshift content, content released by developers outside D&D Beyond, and Critical Role content is considered unofficial and only approved for use if they are in the Homebrew document (i.e. the Blood Hunter class).
> - You cannot multiclass with Homebrew and UA classes/subclasses for balance reasons.
>   - For approved third party content released on D&D Beyond, we will specify if it is eligible for multiclass e.g. Humblewood 
> - If you plan on using Homebrew or UA content, we highly recommend you to use GSheet or DiceCloud sheets due to various limitations of D&D Beyond's Homebrew system.


### [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="DnD World Errata/Variant Feature Document"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n3h5AUgzscyKRJgFIDQkMuLbnl87oOfj4HUalVySXCo/)

Erratas refer to changes made to the official game rules, which our server does for balance reasons and to better suit the West Marches setting. The above document along with the [Erratas and Rulings page](/faq/rulings/) compile all changes to official content and variant features we've added.

## Character Creation

### Ability Scores

> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.

### HP

  - **Do not roll stats on D&D Beyond!**
- You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling. 
- You can switch to rolling from Standard Array/Point Buy if you are still in the character creation phase.
!!!

### Character Details

> 
> - You are **__not__** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

## Character Creation Phase

After you create your character and before the character attends a DM event, you may change parts of the character as many times as you want. The following rules apply:

> - You must keep all rolled results. If you have rolled the stats, you cannot switch back to Standard Array or Point Buy.
> - If you chose Standard Array or Point buy as the Ability Score generation method, you may switch to rolling for stats. Please note, once you have rolled stats, you must use them.
> - You may not switch between choosing starting equipment and rolling for gold.
> - You may not reroll stats / gold / hp.

> - If any of the starting equipment were sold and you need to switch them, retcon the transaction before doing so.
> - Keep RPXP and Experience counter values.

> - You are still in the character creation phase after gaining XP from Combat Training DTD, an approved RPXP claim, or Avrae Tutorial XP.

!!!warning 
Once your character participates in a DM event, all rebuilds must be submitted for review in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rebuild-retire-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946)`, following the rules in [Rebuilding](/records/rebuild/)
