# New to D&D

## What is D&D?

D&D is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) game  published by Wizards of the Coast (WOTC). Each session is typically played with one DM and a party of 4-5 players. The game is a mixture of freeform roleplay (RP), combat, and exploration.

We currently play the **5th Edition (5e)** of the game released in 2014; if you have any books from earlier (e.g. 3.5e, AD&D) or later editions (namely the 2024 rulebooks), please do not use them here as they are not compatible.


## How is D&D played online?

There are a variety of ways to play D&D online. Over here, we use text-based roleplay on Discord, and dice are rolled using the Avrae bot. This is paired with maps on Google Sheets or Owlbear Rodeo.

!!!What about physical dice?
While we appreciate the click-clacks in-person, all our rolls are done using Avrae to prevent cheating.
!!!

## What is West Marches/Living World D&D?

We get the question *"How can I join a campaign?"* quite often. On our server, we don't run campaigns; instead, we run pick-up games where characters carry over between sessions.

Broadly speaking, our server is a living world, which is a unique format of D&D similar to a MMORPG. All characters live in a shared world, and even when you are not in games, you can still interact with other player characters (aka PCs).

To accommodate our size, games are West Marches style with some changes. In West Marches, there are multiple DMs and many players. Rather than having to stick to weekly sessions and a consistent party, games are instead held whenever a DM has time. 

**If you are free at that time, and have a character within that level range, go ahead and sign-up.** The DM will then pick a party. These sessions are typically self-contained one-shots, and there is no overarching plot. This reduces the commitment needed, especially if you just want to try the game.

!!!Not Your Style?
We encourage you to give us a try! Many people who initially joined for campaigns ended up enjoying the atmosphere and stayed on for years. However, if you are *only* looking for traditional campaign-style games, then you are welcome to try the following avenues:

- [Our Partner Servers](/misc/partner-servers/)
- [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="The r/LFG subreddit"](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/)
- [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="The official Dungeons & Dragons server"](https://discord.gg/dnd)

We kindly ask that you do not advertise your campaigns on our server.
!!!

## How Were You Introduced to D&D?

Over the years, we have encountered a wide variety of players from all sorts of backgrounds. However, sometimes this leads to mismanaged expectations on how we personally play D&D. As such, we have compiled this helpful list of common scenarios for you:

==- <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-snatch-hug.webp"> Campaign with Family & Friends
If you've already played D&D before, you may feel like you already have a grasp on D&D's mechanics. However, every table plays differently; some follow the game rules strictly, while others use lots of homebrew or Rule of Cool. Some DMs are totally okay with you rolling up a world-conquering necromancer with an army of robots at Level 1— 

We are not one of them, haha. Due to home games taking these kinds of liberties, we encourage you to pay attention to our rules and open your mind to adjusting expectations.

==- :thumbsup: Memes
Everyone loves a good meme, but it is important to understand that memes only represent one part of the D&D experience. In many cases, they are exaggerated for comedic effect; you probably *won't* be in a party with a witch on a tricycle. As our server lasts up till Level 20, we generally don't encourage you to create joke characters that would only be funny for a few sessions. 

==- :video-camera: Streams/Podcasts (e.g. *Critical Role* or *Dimension 20*)
Streams and podcasts like CR or D20 are popular ways people get introduced to the game. However, it is vital to note that their actors are professionals, and Matt Mercer is a master worldbuilder. As such, you should not expect yourself, other players, or the DM to roleplay to their standard.

!!!Take Note: Critical Role content is considered Homebrew here
We use a modified version of Blood Hunter. For full list of sources, please see [here](cc-rules/)
!!!

==- :video_game: Playing Video Games (e.g. *Baldur's Gate 3*)

RPGs such as *Baldur's Gate 3* has greatly helped expand the accessibility of D&D. While BG3 is quite faithful to the overall experience, Larian Studios has made [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="their own changes"](https://bg3.wiki/wiki/D%26D_5e_rule_changes) to the game.

In addition, as a video game, BG3 has several details that don't translate to the tabletop format. The key difference is that you play collaboratively with your party. No one person is the main character, and you are expected to work with your team to overcome challenges. It is frowned upon to take control of their actions.

Generally, we ask that you don't rip ideas from video games characters for your D&D character. The line between taking inspiration and directly copying can blur quickly. Playing a rogue dual-wielding swords is fine; using Geralt's portrait and having a vaguely-similar backstory is not.

==- :tv: TV Shows (e.g. *Stranger Things*)

In *Stranger Things*, the characters play the *Dungeons & Dragons Expert Set*, which was released in 1981 as an expansion to the 1977 *Basic Set* (not to be confused with the 2014 *Basic Rules*).

Here, we play Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, a more recent and the most popular version of D&D, and have our own homemade setting called Icris, which means you unfortunately won't see villain crossovers like Vecna.

## Planning Your Character

!!!I can play anything I want?!
D&D certainly has a great number of possibilities for what character you want to create. However, you can't just make anything up. Browse D&D Beyond for a list of [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="races"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species) and [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="classes"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes), which will help you greatly in planning your character.

As a Level 1 character, what you can achieve now is limited. The [Backstory Guide](/charcre-v2/4/) goes into more detail about what topics to avoid if you would like to flesh out your backstory.
!!!

Before you begin, start by imagining what kind of character you want to create.

- How is your character's personality like? Are they serious, witty, cold, or emotional?
- Do they care about good and evil, or are they more of a grey character?
- Are they someone who casts spells? A traditional sword and board warrior? Or both?
- What role in the party should they fulfil? Do you want to play a heroic defender who protects others? A skirmisher assassin who lurks in the shadows? A versatile spellcaster who supports their team?
- Which is more important to you, combat or roleplay? Both?
  - Does having an optimized character matter to you?
- Do you want to focus on being good at one thing, or know many different things?
  - The former will be easier to play, while the latter will have higher complexity.

Your answers will influence how you make your choices in the next section. Race/species, class, subclass, and background are key components that come together to fulfil your dream character.

Each class has their own advantages and disadvantages. Below is a simplified list of classes and what each of them focus on:

</p>

!!!warning I want to play a Summoner!
We generally don't encourage new players try a summoner build as their first character. Put simply, **D&D is not designed to accommodate Summoners**, and it will greatly increase the amount of busywork you have to do. If you are set on playing a summoner build, check out [this guide](/tips/video-games-vs-dnd/#summoner).

## How to Learn D&D

!!!Making a Character Sheet
Your character is defined by their Character Sheet, which is the digital paper that details what your character is capable of. You will need one to enter the server proper. Read on to find out more.
!!!

The most comprehensive way to learn D&D is to start with the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**Basic Rules (2014)**"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014). You do not have to read everything all at once, and it is not necessary to read everything:

{.compact}
|Section|Must Read?|
|---|---|
| 1. **Step by Step Characters** | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-yea.webp"> **Yes, please read this.** This section goes hand-in-and with [the below steps](#dd-beyond-character-builder) and will help you make your first DnD character. |
| 2. **Races** | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-yea.webp"> **Skip to those you are interested in** |
| 3. **Classes** | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-yea.webp"> **Skip to those you are interested in** |
| 4. Personalities & Backgrounds | :point_right: Skip directly to Backgrounds section (you can come up with your own Character Details) |
| 5. Equipment | :point_right: Unless you plan on manually calculating your stats, a quick skim will do |
| 6. Customization Options | :hourglass_flowing_sand: Ignore this for now; you can read it when you level up |
| 7. **Ability Scores** | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-yea.webp"> **Absolutely necessary to read** |
| 8. Adventuring | :point_right: Skip directly to The Environment; this section is more situational so a quick skim will do |
| 9. **Combat** | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-yea.webp"> **Absolute necessary to read** |
| 10. **Spellcasting** | :point_right: **Only if you play a spellcasting class.** You can skip if you are starting as a Barbarian, Fighter, Monk or Rogue. |
| 11. Spells | :point_right: Skip for now; for spellcasters, you can read the Level 1 spells on your sheet later. |
| Monsters | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-nay.webp"> Don't read this. |
| Building Combat Encounters | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-nay.webp"> Don't read this. |
| Magic Items | :hourglass_flowing_sand: Ignore for now. |
| Appendix A | :point_right: Useful reference, give it a skim if anything remains unclear. |
| Appendix B-D | <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-nay.webp"> Don't read this. |

If this felt overwhelming, you can also read the somewhat simplified [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="SRD Document"](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf). This is helpful if you struggle to read long blocks of text and only want to read the most important parts. If you require more detailed explanation, the Basic Rules above are better.

Don't worry, this will come with time. It is only important that you eventually familiarize yourself with your Character Sheet, so that you can play games smoothly.

## D&D Beyond Character Builder
### 1. Race
> Races refer to human, elves, dwarves, etc. Each race can provide some mechanical benefit to your character in game, such as stats, traits, or even spells! For approved/disapproved materials, see [Character Creation Rules](cc-rules/).
> - More extensive descriptions on races can be found [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races)
> 
> However, as we are not using the WOTC world, take their descriptions and lore with a grain of salt, e.g. Tieflings are pretty common in the server so they do not suffer as much discrimination as described.

### 2. Class
> Reminder: Your character on this server starts at Level 1. 
> 
> Your class helps determine your character’s specialty. Each class has unique features that can affect how they interact with the world. 
> - For short summary of each class, see [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1047-d-d-101-a-quick-breakdown-of-classes-in-dungeons).

#### Proficiencies
> Your race, background, and class will allow you to choose proficiencies among certain skills and tools. This means you are especially good at this skill/tool and can add your proficiency bonus to it when making checks for that task. Proficiency bonus is a number that increases as you level, and at Level 1 it is +2.

#### Skills
> Each skill uses one of your abilities (more on this below). 
> - For details on each skills, see [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#UsingEachAbility). 

### 3. Abilities
> - General tips for ability score arrangements depending on class: [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="*Handbooker Helper: Ability Scores*"](https://youtu.be/WoV5iM7peOg) by Critical Role  

#### Ability Scores Generation Methods
> - **Standard Array**: If you want to save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining ability scores, you can choose from a fixed list `[15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8]`.
> - **Point Buy**: Customize your ability scores by spending points. If you are playing an Adventurers League character, choose this option. 
>   - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Point Buy calculator website"](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) 
> - **Manual**: Roll the stats in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264), **NOT** in D&D Beyond 
>   - Follow the pinned note in the channel for instruction. 
>   - Choose “Manual/Rolled” for the Generation Method

### 4. Description

#### Background
> Backgrounds are different but closely linked to backstories. Your background gives your char certain abilities and special features depending on how they spent their lives before becoming an adventurer. 
> - For information on each background, see [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds).

#### Others
> The rest are optional and are for adding personality and different aspects to your character. Bring them to life! The personality traits, characteristics, etc. lists are providing you with examples. You do not need to choose from the tables. 
> - Faith: Check out ⁠pantheon for the gods of Icris. 
> - Lifestyle: This is handled in the DW server, not in D&D Beyond. Continue following the Getting Started guides to learn more. 
> - Additional fun resource for character creation: [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="*Is your D&D Character Too Perfect?*"](https://youtu.be/5DECGUi_hQc) by Ginny Di 

### 5. Equipment
> You can choose from either a recommended list of starting equipment or roll for gold and do the shopping yourself. 
> - If you are new to D&D, we recommend you choose the starting equipment option. 
> - If you choose to take starting equipment, the items must be available in the regular market of Snowhaven, found [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU/)

#### Rolling for Gold
> If you choose to roll for gold, you MUST make the rolls in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264), **NOT** in D&D Beyond. You can then do the equipment shopping after you upload your character. Follow the prices in the Snowhaven Market document above, and log the transactions in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#transaction-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531011819095982081).
