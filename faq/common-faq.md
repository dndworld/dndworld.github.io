# Common FAQ

This page is for commonly asked questions.

==- "Gee, this is a lot of channels!"

Due to the complexity of D&D, the age of the server, and the general number of rulings that have been made to standardize procedures across the server, there are a lot of channels. 

Most channels will be necessary at one point, but you can (and should) only read those that are relevant to you as you progress through the server. Let's see if we can help you out!

==- "I'm new here! Where do I start?"
Welcome to DnD World! We are text-only D&D 5e server with a homebrew world setting. You can find out more about the server and the world in [About Us](/). 

General Conduct of this server is in place to ensure the pleasant experience of the members in a large server. You can find them in [Rules](/rules/).

You do not have access to the rest of the server until you import your first character. For that, please visit [Start Here](/character-building/start-here/) and follow the steps there. If you are new to D&D, [New to D&D](/character-building/new-to-dnd/) has a step-by-step guide to help you through the character creation process.

If you have any questions, we have a few question channels depending on what your question is about! This page has commonly asked questions listed, and your question might already be answered here. 

[!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584) is the default place for most questions. Specific questions for D&D rulings visit `#rulings-questions`, and if your question is about bot commands, first check `#avrae-commands` to see if the information can be found there, otherwise ask for help in `#bot-help-request`.

==- "Why can I not see all the channels?"
Once you make your character and import it to `#character-sheets`, you will be able to see the rest of the server. Head over to [Start Here](/character-building/start-here/) for the guide. If you are new to D&D, follow the step-by-step guide in [New to D&D](/character-building/new-to-dnd/)!

==- "How do I make a D&D character?"
The steps are outlined in [Start Here](/character-building/start-here/). If you are new to DnD and unfamiliar with the character creation process, [New to D&D](/character-building/new-to-dnd/) is for you!

If you'd like to ask for general advice from fellow players, or brainstorm character ideas, `#character-idea-discussion` is a great place to do so!

What official, homebrew, and UA sources and content we allow can be found in [Character Creation Rules](/character-building/cc-rules/).

You have an option to ask for a review of your character sheet in `#review-request`, but it is not required.

==- "Where can I ask questions?"
[!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584) is where you can ask all server-related questions.

If you have a question about a specific topic, please take a look at "Guides and Q&A Channels by Topic" Section in `#channel-guide`

==- "Where can I RP?", "How do I start RPing?"
Once you have your character imported in `#character-sheets`, you will see all RP channels under various categories. A common way of introducing your character is to describe their first entrance to Snowhaven in `#gates`. 

`#drunken-yeti-tavern` is open for anyone to walk in and start RPing. It's a great place for your characters to meet and hang out with other characters. For other channels, if there is an ongoing RP, it is a good etiquette to ask first in the ooc channel of the category whether you can join in. 

You can also make a post in `#rp-board`, if you'd like to find other players who would like to RP together in one of many RP channels.

Please make sure to follow [Roleplay Rules](/rp-rules/) for your RPs! You can earn RPXP when you are interacting with other characters. To learn more about this, please checkout "RPXP" sections in [How To Start Playing](/start-playing/start-playing/) and [What's Next?](/start-playing/whats-next/). The RPXPs and XPs need to be logged in `#⁠xp-tracker`.

==- "Where can I find the games?", "How do I join them?"
The games are posted in `#bounty-board` and `#arena-board`. We don't have any particular schedule, because the games are run by our team of volunteer DMs at times when they are available.

To learn more about all types of available games on this server, please visit "DM Events" section in [How to Earn XP](/start-playing/earn-xp/#3-dm-events/). For instruction on how to join them, visit "Signing up for DM events" section of [How To Start Playing](/start-playing/start-playing/#signing-up-for-dm-events/).

==- "How can my character make money?"
We use Lifestyle and Downtime Days (DTD) system. You can find the rules and guides in [Lifestyle and DTD Rules](/downtime/). All relevant channels can be found under the same category. With this system you can find an odd job for day-to-day earnings, or a part-time work for a more consistent pay. There are many more options! If you still have questions after reading the guide, ask for help in `#dtd-ls-discussion`.

You might also like to check out the guilds under Guilds category. Guilds are managed by players, and each guild may have different requirements for becoming a member. With a guild membership you get additional options and bonuses for various DTDs.

==- "Not sure what to do..."
In DnD World, the games happen when our volunteer DMs have time and capacity. This leaves the players plenty of time for all sorts of other activities to further your experience. We encourage you to take advantage of these options and explore all the server has to offer! Here are some examples:

**Chat in OOC channels**
> Check out the channels under the OOC category, as well as Topical Interests.

**Roleplay with other characters**
> `#rp-board` is there for you to arrange the roleplays. Take a look at "Where can I RP?", "How do I start RPing?" section above for more details.

**Do DTD**
> Downtime Day (DTD) activities are how your characters can make money, gain extra experience points, or heal injuries. Check out "How can my character make money?" section above for more details.

**Join a Guild**
> You can see the list of available guilds under the Guilds category. They are all player managed, and the requirements of joining a guild vary. Check their pinned messages for such requirements or inquire with their leader if they don't specify any.

**Request NPC encounters**
Check out `#npc-registry` to learn how to request NPC encounters.

==- "How does one become an Active Player?"
This role is automatically assigned by the bot after you have sent a few thousand messages.

==- "I like this server! How can I contribute?"
This server could not be possible without the time and care put in by our volunteering staff members. You can contribute to the server in many ways by joining the team. For more information, please check out `#staff-roles`.

There are plenty of other ways you can contribute. You can make server-wide improvement suggestions in `#server-suggestions`, or join the discussion for the suggestions in `#suggestion-discussion`. Please keep in mind, implementing the suggestions may take time and upvotes alone do not mean it will be approved.

We also have a `feedback` form for reporting errors such as typos, outdated information, or any missing information that needs to be documented.

## Common FAQ for Character Creation
These are some of the more frequently asked questions we gathered over the years.

==- Can I start with any pets/creatures? (`!faq pets`)
No, unless your background specifies having one. You can later purchase one in from the market in the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#market-district"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/523139404726927370).

==- Why can I not choose Boomerang (or other options) as a starting equipment?
Boomerangs are classified as exotic weapons on the server, and are not eligible as starting equipment. You can purchase them separately through the [Market Doc](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/131lUJSH1DX0FLMfKKlO9irCnfG6zjwbjjG5-HKstWsU/>).

==- (For Warlocks) Do I have to specify who my warlock patron is?  (`!faq warlock-patron`)
For your patron, they are unnamed unless they can be found in the existing lore.

As a player, you can define your patron as long as they are not lore-breaking or lore-defining. For example, you cannot replace or create powerful devils, celestials, etc. They cannot interact with your character physically, unless propagated by a DM.

==- Can my new PC be an undead version of my old, dead PC? (`!faq undead-pc`)
No.

==- My character has the soldier background, what are some wars they could have taken part in? 
> If your character is from Icris, they might have fought in the Taffetan War. You can read more about the war’s progress by heading to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#lore"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/740905255201669161), typing `in:lore taffeta` in your search bar and sorting by Oldest first.
> If your character is from Eo, they might have fought in the Time of Darkness. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EBgQscpqcqAV8lPyDl1sc8HBP83vnN4aw9ZBg9ZO5fk/edit?usp=sharing)

==- What are the Warforged origins in this server? 
God of Knowledge, Cheong created the first warforged during the last Great War. However, his original blueprints were lost when the Labyrinth collapsed. Now, most modern warforged are replications made by powerful artificers. As such, not all warforged need to be built for war.

==- Do you get a spellbook if you multiclass to wizard? 
Yes

==- Can I wild shape into X? (`!faq wildshape`)
> Wild Shape specifies that you can turn into "a **beast** that **you have seen before**". You may decide what kind of animals you've seen based on what makes sense for your backstory, and choosing from any sources allowed as per [Character Creation Rules](/character-building/cc-rules/). Here are some noteworthy specifications:
> - Dinosaur: Dinosaurs only exist in the Pelgara Archipelago on the continent of Eo. Hence, your character must have originated from there or previously traveled there.
> - Some beasts are not native to Icris (for example creatures from supplementary adventures like Tome of Annihilation), hence you would not have seen them before. If you later see them in-game, then you might be able to transform into them at your respective DMs' discretion.
> - Attempting to transform into an awakened animal results in you transforming into the non-awakened version of the animal.

==- "How does this server handle Artificer infusions?"
Any infusions that are not your own are considered as prebuffs in the context of DM events. The DM of an event has the final say in whether such prebuff is allowed in their game.

Any longterm recipient of an infusion needs to be of a character level equivalent to an artificer's level that would have the infusion.
==- What exactly is "Customizing Your Origin" and how can I use it?
Customizing your Origin allows you to do any and all of the following things at character creation:

1. __Change the Ability Score Increases given by your race.__ You can take these and assign them to any other stats that you want. For example, if your race normally gives +2 Dexterity and +1 Wisdom, you can instead make that +2 Charisma and +1 Strength. The split of your Ability Score Increases must remain the same though, so you can't, for instance, combine a +2 and a +1 into a +3, and also can't split up a +2 into two +1s.

2. __Change the languages learned from your race.__ You can take any of the languages your race normally knows, and replace them with different ones from this list:
```markdown
Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, Undercommon
```
3. __Change proficiencies gained from your race.__ You can replace certain proficiencies your race grants, such as skills, tools, or weapons, with certain different ones, as seen below:


Original                | Replacement
---                     | ---
Skill                   | Skill
Simple weapon or tool   | Simple weapon or tool
Martial weapon or armor | Simple/martial weapon or tool

*Yes, that means you **can't** swap an armor proficiency for a different armor proficiency.*

==- What is the difference between Hexblade and Pact Weapons?

Hex Warrior only                | :white_check_mark: | :x:                
Pact of the Blade only          | :x:                | :white_check_mark:     
Hex Warrior + Pact of the Blade ⹋ | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: (except Hex Warrior weapon)

> \* Counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming magical resistance or immunity against nonmagical attacks and damage<br>
> † Can use Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls<br>
> ‡ Can summon as an action and dismiss at-will<br>
> ⹋ As a reminder, if you have both features, you can have a Hex Weapon separate from your Pact Weapon. Your Pact Weapon always benefits from your Hex Warrior feature (being able to use your charisma modifier for attack and damage), but your Hex Weapon does not benefit from your Pact of the Blade features if it is not your Pact Weapon.<br>
> **Improved Pact Weapon:** Pact Weapon becomes a spellcasting focus and a +1 weapon (unless it already has that bonus), and can be a melee weapon or a shortbow, longbow, light crossbow, or heavy crossbow.
