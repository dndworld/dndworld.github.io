# Erratas and Rulings

D&D is written in the style of "rulings over rules", which means that the books should only be taken as a guideline and DMs have the final say. Despite mass protests by D&D players over the years that this puts the burden on the DM and they paid for a rulebook to, well, communicate rules, WOTC has stuck to their guns.

The result is in the following:
- Core rulebooks have many rules to cover the possibly infinite scenarios that can arise from D&D
- Rules that are unclear are clarified in Sage Advice, which are written by D&D's co-designer Jeremy Crawford and his team. These are compiled [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://media.wizards.com/2021/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf) from Jeremy's Twitter account. These are called “rulings”, as they depend on interpretation and are not necessarily correct, but can be used as guidance.
- Rulings that are still unclear or the server deems are interpreted incorrectly are overridden by Mentor+ staff or Admins.
- DMs may have their own house rules if they choose to rule something differently

As such, Staff rulings, changes, and erratas to the game are compiled here for easy access.

## Rule Clarifications

### General
==- **Can you refer to classes in character?**
**Interpretation:** The idea of character classes is a meta concept. A character belonging to a class does not necessarily identify themselves with the word the rules use for that class.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/621035485690724369/826215429629280296)
```yaml **Tags**
Class/Classfeat: Class
Server Rule Keyword: Roleplay
```
==- **Leveling between game acceptance and game start**
**Interpretation:** XP from combat training (and likely other sources) is applied immediately but it's up to each individual dm to either replace the one who leveled or let them stay, even if the game is out of their new level range.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/796859071915360297)
```yaml **Tags**
Server Rule Keyword: XP, Level, DM Event
```
==- **Using your shield arm for somatic components**
**Description:** Performing somatic components for spells as a Paladin or Cleric, using your shield arm due to your shield being your focus.<br>
**Interpretation:** If your Holy Symbol is on your shield, you may use that hand to perform somatic components of spells that have a material component that do not have a gold cost for their material component and do not have their material component consumed.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/928138006085382234)
```yaml **Tags**
Class/Classfeat: Paladin, Cleric, Holy Symbol
Spell: Somatic Components
Item: Spellcasting Focus
```
===

### Races/Species

==- **Awakened Animals and Components**
**Interpretation:** Awakened Animal PCs can use their paws for somatic components.

Additionally, druids/rangers can wear any type of accessory (i.e. tiara, hairpin) made of mistletoe to bypass having to hold druidic foci for just material components. As long as you have a hand (can be the same one for somatic components) to at least touch the focus when you cast spells.<br>

```yaml **Tags**

Class/Classfeat: Druid, Ranger
Item: Spellcasting focus, Druidic focus
```
==- **Awakened Animals and Arcane Armor**
**Interpretation:** If you normally would not be able to wear the armor due to a trait like Quadruped Frame, you ignore that trait with the arcane armor.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord (staff channel)"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/803192028200304660/1297619286424293497)
```yaml **Tags**
Race/Racefeat: Awakened Animal's Quadruped Form
Subclass/Subclassfeat: Armorer Artificer's Arcane Armor
```
==- **Feral Tiefling from MTOF and Tiefling Bloodlines from SCAG**
**Interpretation:** you cannot play a feral tiefling with a different bloodline than the Bloodline of Asmodeus subrace from the PHB, meaning that feral tieflings are only compatible with the Winged, Devil's Tongue, and Hellfire variant traits.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/871745695491715173)

==- **Druid: Wild Shape Clarification**
**Rule:** You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before

==- **Monk: Dedicated Weapon**
**Interpretation:** If the one weapon is a dart, then you can treat all darts as monk weapons. May extend to other thrown weaponry.<br>

==- **Monk: Shields, Magic Shields, and the Martial Arts class feature**
**Interpretation:** For the purposes of a shield (specifically magic shields), "holding" a shield is the same thing as "wearing" or "wielding" said shield.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/730973655496130637/832993547275862077)

```yaml **Tags**

==- **Paladin: Smite Spells with Unarmed Strikes**
**Interpretation:** Smite spells like Thunderous Smite can be applied to melee attacks made using unarmed strikes or natural weapons without requiring the caster to hold a weapon.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/899327893098889268)

==- **Warlock: Replacing your Book of Shadows**
**Interpretation:** If a warlock with the Pact of the Tome feature uses the ritual to receive a replacement for their Book of Shadows from their patron, it has the same contents as before, including miscellaneous content not related to your warlock class features.<br>

### Feats

==- **Chef: Ingredient requirements and other forms of cooking**
**Interpretation:** The costs of ingredients for cooking or preparing treats, while done in snowhaven and outside of bounties, are covered by Lifestyle or the Snowhaven Full Time Adventurer Scheme. If you are in a bounty and would prepare treats and/or cook food you must have the perquisite ingredients in order to do so. A DM may choose to bypass this restriction through foraging or other means.

```yaml **Tags**
Feat: Chef
Item: Cooking ingredients
```
==- **Durable feat and Periapt of Wound Closure**
**Interpretation:** The phrase "Hit points you regain from the [Hit Die] roll" refers to dice roll + CON mod
- For Durable Feat: "the minimum number of hit points you regain from the roll equals twice your Constitution modifier" means any dice result on the hit dice that is lower than the constitution modifier is replaced with the con mod before adding the mod to the result, which is 2*your con mod. e.g. If you have a con mod of 4, any number on the hit dice roll that is lower than 4 becomes 4, and then you add 4 to the dice, which is 8.
- For Periapt of Wound Closure: "whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores." means you double the sum of dice roll + CON mod, e.g. If you have a con mod of 4 and the dice roll was 6, you regain (4 + 6) x 2 = 20 hit points.

```yaml **Tags**
Feat: Durable
Item: Periapt of Wound Closure
```
==- **Scythes and Polearm Master Feat**
**Interpretation** The homebrew scythe weapon is considered a glaive and works with the Polearm Master feat.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/1138591406798143529)
```yaml **Tags**
Feat: Polearm Master
Item: Scythe
```
===

### Spells

==- **Animate Dead: Do you need to have the spell prepared to command the undead?**
**Interpretation:** No, but if you can't cast the spell again once the 24 hours are up, the undead escape from your control. So unless that is intended, it is unlikely to be able to unprepare and prepare it again before the time is up.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/927497861430665277)
```yaml **Tags**
Spell: Animate Dead
```
==- **Animate Dead: Can Undead (specifically skeletons) have additional armor/armaments over what is listed in their statblock?**
**Interpretation:** Yes, but they are only proficient in shortbows/shortswords, and scraps of armor. Anything else would require the rules for using equipment you are not proficient in.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/927633870050955265)
```yaml **Tags**
Item: Weapons/Equipment, Proficiency
```
==- **Animate Dead: Killing undead created by the spell** 
**Description:** The remains of the undead created by Animate Dead do not disappear without being explicitly destroyed.<br>
**Interpretation:** If an undead created by Animate Dead is killed, their remains do not disappear (unless explicitly destroyed by an effect such as Disintegration) and can thus be reanimated with another casting of Animate Dead.<br>

E.g. The summoner can kill their undead servants and then reanimate them at no additional material cost. You may kill your undead servants without DM oversight so long as they are still under your control.
```yaml **Tags**
Spell: Animate Dead
```
==- **Command: Does the command "Daydream" break concentration?**
**Interpretation:** No, since nothing in the spell's description specifies it breaking concentration nor inflicting the incapacitated condition (which does break concentration).<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/927269017188720670)

==- **Mage Armor: Interactions with shields**
**Interpretation:** A shield is in the armor section, but not considered armor for the purposes of ending Mage Armor<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/781550250229235712)
```yaml **Tags**

==- **Protection from Evil and Good: Component Costs**
**Interpretation:** The amount of holy water consumed per casting is negligible, but it's not possible to replace the holy water with a spellcasting focus.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/694402377075392583)

==- **Revivify, Reincarnation, Resurrection, etc.: Can Diamond Dust Be Used as a Material Component?**
**Interpretation:** If the spell specifies "A Diamond" it needs a singular diamond. If it says "Diamonds", then Diamond Dust is fine.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513452707617570828/927743658235666523)

### Multiclassing

==- **Bard/Rogue: Does Jack of All Trades stack with Reliable Talent?**
**Interpretation:** No, you're not considered proficient in skills boosted via Jack of All Trades, therefore Reliable Talent does not apply.<br>

**Interpretation:** If you have Extra Attack, you can use the Soulknife rogue's Psychic Blades feature for all attacks made as part of an Attack action, making a new blade for each attack.<br>

```yaml **Tags**

```
==- **Spellcasting Foci and multiclassing, material components and free hands**
**Interpretation:** When multiclassed between 2 caster classes that require different types of Spellcasting Focuses, you must have a separate focus for each class's spells. E.G. A Cleric/Warlock would need a Holy Symbol and an Arcane Focus; a Sorcerer/Warlock would only need one Arcane Focus.

Additionally, if you are casting a spell that has a GP cost as a material component, you must have a free hand that's not holding a shield nor weapon.<br>

==- **Using magical spellcasting foci for different classes**
**Interpretation:**  If a magic item says "If you're a spellcaster, you can use this item as a spellcasting focus", you can use it as a spellcasting focus even if it isn't a type of item your class can normally use as a focus.<br>

## Erratas
==- **Drow: Sunlight Sensitivity**
**Changes:** Sunlight Sensitivity is an optional feature, and is no longer required.<br>
**Link to discussion:** [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Discord (staff channel)"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/803192028200304660/1203409654034472960)
```yaml **Tags**

```
==- **Equipment: Ring of Spell Storing** 
**Changes:** Any benefits or changes granted by a spell or spell effect, including instantaneous effects such as Find Familiar and Find (Greater) Steed, cast from the Ring of Spell Storing end when a creature other than you attunes to the item.<br>

```yaml **Tags**
Class/Classfeat: Spellcasting
Item: Ring of Spell Storing
```
==- **Feat: Cartomancer**
**Changes:**
- The spell cast as a bonus action via *Hidden Ace* still requires a spell slot (or some other means of circumventing that requirement, like casting a spell which is both on your spell list and something you know as a racial spell) to be cast.
- You may only designate one spell as your Hidden Ace per long rest, and may only use your Hidden Ace to cast a spell as a BA once per long rest -- no, you cannot abuse this feat by multiclassing and acquiring multiple spell lists.
- Your Hidden Ace must be of a spell level you can cast normally: you cannot play a wizard 19 / cleric 1 who grabs this feat to select and cast Mass Heal as a BA. You could, however, select a 1st-level cleric spell and cast it as a BA using any level of spell slot available to you.

```yaml **Tags**

==- **Feat: Divinely Favored**
**Changes:** The feat's 1st-level spell list is determined by the character's alignment at the time they take the feat. Changing the spell list requires a rebuild.<br>

==- **Spell: Casting Spells While Transformed (e.g. Polymorph)**
**Description:** Some spells, such as True Polymorph, allow a spellcaster to transform a creature into a different creature or summon a creature, which may respectively gain or have the ability to cast particular spells without requiring spell components.<br>
**Changes:** The transformed creature must still provide any material components that has a cost and/or is consumed for the casting of these spells. If the creature was summoned, the spellcaster who summoned it must provide such components instead. If the component is consumed by the spell, the component must be provided for each casting of the spell.<br>
