# Scheduling Roleplay

Most roleplay (RP) in our server happens spontaneously. You can just walk into any open RP channel and find someone you'd like to talk to. However, we also provide the option to plan your roleplay. [The RP Board](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/893946822404493392) is for you to indicate to other players that you are seeking RP. Use that channel to request for:

- ✅ Slower paced, PBP, or 1 to 1 RP (suitable for overwhelmed newbies)
- ✅ Checking availability at a certain time
- ✅ Doing a specific activity (e.g. sparring, fishing, touring the town)

- ❌ Asking for permission to use RP channels  (that is not required)
- ❌ Encounters with NPCs (that is [`#npc-registry`](/advanced-play/npc-registry))
- ❌ Advertising campaigns (that is not allowed on the server)

Before making your own post, consider checking the queue to see if another RPer has already made one that matches your description and ping them to RP. Delete your post once you have found a partner.

Keep the channel discussion free and open a thread from someone's post or ping them in the OOC channel of their channel of choice if you are interested in RPing with them or would like to comment on their post.
