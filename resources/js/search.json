These suggestions are not technically against the rules, but are usually denied because of one or more of these reasons. This post is meant to encourage petitioners to fine tune their suggestions so it stands a higher chance of getting approved.","The suggestion lacks a feasible solution Factors that are out of our control such as timezones, Discord limitations, bot limitations, availability limitations all fall into this category. Examples include more staff, more games, more events, etc.","The suggestion does not fit the design of the server An unchangeable aspect is that the server is a West Marches/Living World server. Suggestions that rely on elements that are an antithesis to the server's design fall into this category, such as LFG systems, fixed party/campaign systems, and hobby discussion channels.","The suggestion lacks crucial information Often coming in the form of suggestions that lack solutions, these suggestions cannot or are difficult to be understood. A substantial suggestion must have a clear intent, purpose, and implementation.","The suggestion is too long On the flip side, a suggestion can be too long, often overloaded with multiple suggestions in one post or very complicated solutions, which makes them too wordy and difficult to read.","The suggestion is unbalanced There is simply too much room for exploitation, and the amount of work to salvage the suggestion is not worth it.","The suggestion takes too much effort for little payoff Sometimes a suggestion fits all the criteria and is really great, but simply cannot be done because the amount of time and energy needed is not worth the potential payoff. Suggestions that involve overhauling major systems in order to fix a small exploit/detail falls under this category."]},{"l":"Statement on Guild System","p":["So we'd like to get it out there that it's very unlikely for any mechanical changes to the guild system to be implemented within the foreseeable future. There are a couple reasons for this, mainly because the team is currently focused on other aspects of the server at the moment, others like the fact that the system is very very old and most of the people who worked on it are no longer on the team.","The guild system is massively complex and has a lot of moving parts, and trying to make one change inevitably affects another part of the system. We also don't want to put ourselves in a situation where us making one change creates a demand for changes in another part in the system, which makes the process more time-consuming than it already is. If changes do come, it would have to be part of a planned major revamp.","For context, things I would consider a major project on our side takes about 3 months to develop (the Black Market changes comes to mind) and that was with me buckling down for 2 weeks not doing anything else except eating, sleeping, and entering numbers into a spreadsheet. Changes to the guild system takes even longer than that to process.","From a design perspective, the guild system is also in a unique place. Going off the general conversations in #suggestion-discussion, its clear a lot of people have different things they want to get out of the server. This means that trying to make a change is even more difficult for us, because we have to balance all these different perspectives at play, including what the team would like to achieve out of a change.","This isn't to say your suggestions are all bad or anything, we just don't want you to feel discouraged if these things aren't implemented. We do care about how you guys experience the guild system and in an ideal world we could tell you whether these things are possible very quickly, but this isn't really the situation currently.","-- FG (Server Owner), 2023-04-05"]}],[{"l":"The X-Card System","p":["For a comment (either IC or OOC), that makes a player uncomfortable without being directly rule breaking, players may react to the post with a scamXCard:.","A way to anonymously state someone is feeling uncomfortable.","Useful if someone is not comfortable with speaking up at that moment, as it is a non-verbal communication of one's personal boundaries","Adds nuance and reduces hostility in grey areas.
