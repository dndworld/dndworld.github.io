In single player games, you have more flexibility to play how you want, and you can go off and choose to kill the villager just to see the consequences.","In D&D, being a lone wolf is a generally ineffective strategy and will likely lead to disappointment. Much of Dnd World relies on interplayer roleplay outside games. In addition, taking the most chaotic path for no reason other than for seeing the world burn is generally frowned upon and is termed “Chaotic Stupid”. This is because this derails the adventure that the DM has painstakingly crafted, and affects the experience of your teammates who may want to play seriously.","This is not to say you cannot attempt antics. You just have to use your judgment to determine when is the time for it. Befriending the villager or the misunderstood villain? Go ahead! Taking an impromptu shopping trip with said villager, or trying to befriend the mindless mummy screaming death in your face? Probably a bad call that stalls the experience for everyone else.","As a rule of thumb, if the game is approaching the 8th hour and someone is already commenting they need to sleep soon, now is a good time to wrap things up and not a good time to attempt antics."]},{"l":"Time is Wonky","p":["In most video games, progression is in real time. This is also true for our roleplay channels. However, in combat, time is usually handwaved or dictated by the DM. This is because D&D is designed such that a round (where everyone gets a turn) lasts 6 seconds. 10 rounds is a full minute.","Yet, in real life, each turn usually takes a couple of minutes, and a round can last an hour or more. D&D battles also usually don’t hit the 10 round mark. As such, in order to retain the epicness of battle, suspension of belief is required."]},{"i":"there-is-no-save-pointauto-respawn","l":"There is No Save Point/Auto Respawn","p":["In D&D, revivals are expensive and as such usually unavailable to low levels. The cheapest revival method costs 300gp ( Revivify) and requires a class available to cast it within one minute of death. Once you die in a game, unless you are immediately revived, you are out of the game. Your friends or guild mates will have to arrange the revival for you, if they want to and can afford it.","As such, suicide plays are not encouraged. Retreats are usually available and can be the best option if you deem the battle unwinnable. Just be sure to communicate with your party before retreating, as abandoning your teammates is bad form."]},{"i":"you-dont-have-to-kill-all-enemies","l":"You Don’t Have to Kill All Enemies","p":["Unlike games, where video game characters are programmed to do a certain set of actions, there are infinite possibilities in D&D. As such, you can choose other courses of action, such as befriending, negotiating, or tricking enemies into noncombat. Just see the section about teamwork above."]},{"l":"Character Roles","p":["Now for the fun stuff! In multiplayer games, you may be familiar with certain concepts of character roles. We will go over those basic concepts and how they interact with D&D’s rule system.","It should be noted that with how many subclasses and feats have been released since D&D 5e’s original publication, every class can be built to fulfill tankiness, damage, or support roles. Some are just designed to do it better than others; Other classes can do this but only with specific builds. This guide is just to give you a simplistic idea.","Contents:","Tank","DPS","Summoner","Healer","Support"]},{"l":"Tank","p":["A tank is someone with a lot of health, designed to take the brunt of enemy damage. This role relies on good positioning and builds that aggro enemies as well as punishes them for attacking teammates. This is best displayed in the Barbarian class, as well as the Fighter class to a slightly less extent.","To maximize tankiness, sink your highest stats into Constitution, in order to increase your Hit Points(HP). This will increase the amount of damage you can take. At higher levels, you can also take feats that increase your health, such as Tough.","Also be sure to increase your Armor Class(AC) as much as possible. This determines the minimum roll needed to hit you, and the higher the better. AC depends on two things: your Dexterity score and the armor you are wearing (determined by your class and affordability).","Dexterity determines how agile you are and in turn how hard you are to hit. As with Constitution, the higher the stat you allocate for this, the better. Your Dexterity modifier (not to be confused with score) is added to your base armor to give your final AC. For example, if you are wearing Leather armor, and you have a Dexterity score of 14, your AC is","11 [Base Armor for Leather] +2 [Dexterity modifier] =13","Classes designed to be tanky such as Barbarian and Fighter will give you access to medium or heavy armor, which allows you to have higher AC. Barbarian also has Unarmored Defense, which allows you to forgo armor and instead only use your Dexterity modifier. As you level and save more money, you will also be able to afford more expensive armor, which will increase your AC."]},{"l":"DPS","p":["A DPS is someone who does a lot of damage but sacrifices other aspects such as health and utility. This role relies on good movement as well as builds that have both reliable damage and features/spells that mitigates hits. Although many classes in D&D fit this category, it is most evident in Fighter, Rogue, Monk, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard.","To maximize your damage, be sure to sink your highest stats into the stat you use to attack. For Rogues and Monks, this is Dexterity, and for spellcasters, this is referred to as your casting stat and defers by class.","It should be noted not all spells, feats, or subclasses are created equal. Some are more situational than others. If you love optimizing your character, you are advised to research guides and discuss with other players for your ideal build."]},{"i":"special-mention-glass-cannons","l":"Special Mention: Glass Cannons","p":["Wizard deserves a special mention for the fact that they are the prime example of a Glass Cannon. Their d6 hit die paired with no bonus to constitution saves (unlike the Sorcerer) makes them susceptible to both weapons and spells. However, at higher levels, they gain more and more abilities to counter these."]},{"i":"special-mention-aoe-damage","l":"Special Mention: AOE damage","p":["Some classes have access to spells that dole out Area of Effect (AOE) damage. AOE damage affects all creatures standing within a certain area as designated by the spell.","D&D has friendly fire, and you can harm your teammates if you do not position your spells properly. In worst case scenarios, especially for a specific spell called Fireball, this can cause your teammates to die.","As such, it is impertinent that you communicate with your teammates on the turn before you unleash a high damage AOE spell in an area they are standing on. This is such that they can move out of the way, or if they can’t, you should reconsider the spell you are using."]},{"l":"Summoner","p":["A Summoner is someone who summons multiple creatures in order to divide the attention of enemies, giving the party more room to attack the enemies. Creatures can usually attack enemies themselves, and are controlled by the player. This role relies on maintaining concentration of the spell while also making use of positioning.","While this could technically fall under DPS, it gets a special mention because of the fact that D&D is not designed to support summoners. D&D’s initiative system means that each creature summoned has to perform actions individually, and even if creatures are grouped, due to their numerous nature, they usually take time to act. As such, it can make combat grind to a halt.","That said, if you really want to play a Summoner, the Druid is the best example of this, as it gives you access to most spells that start with “Conjure” or “Summon”. To a lesser extent, Ranger also gives you access to “Conjure Animals”, the lowest level and most commonly used summoning spell. The Ranger subclass Beast Master also gives you access to an animal companion at 3rd level.","For summoners, as your need to maintain concentration is impertinent, you may consider taking feats such as War Caster or Resilient: Constitution."]},{"l":"Healer","p":["A Healer is someone whose main ability is restoring lost health to their teammates. As with how multiplayer games are usually played, Healers tend to be few in number and are thus higher in demand.","It should be noted D&D does not have any classes that are designed to only heal. Healers can usually do other things which overlaps with the DPS or Support category. That said, classes that are best at healing are the Cleric, Bard, and Druid.","Some classes or subclasses have features that provide small amounts of healing. This is usually termed as backup heals and is found in the Paladin and Ranger classes as well as the Celestial Warlock, Divine Soul Sorcerer, Alchemist Artificer and Way of Mercy Monk subclasses. However, as these heals are small and usually come as a sacrifice for other abilities, it is recommended that each party has a designated healer and the backup is reserved for when the main healer is down.","Still, because of the aforementioned way of how D&D is designed, classes can only be effective healers if the character is built to fulfill that role. Case in point, if you do not pick any healing spells, you would simply be a DPS or Support class despite playing a Bard. It's recommended that you pick at least one healing spell if you play one of these classes, as people tend to expect some mode of backup healing if you are part of the party.","D&D is also designed in such a way that it is much more effective to deal out damage (hence stopping the enemy) as compared to healing damage taken. As such, you should consider timing heals for teammates at low health or when they are unconscious. Keep in mind spell slots (and in turn healing) is limited and should be conserved.","If you want to do some healing but your class does not have healing abilities, consider purchasing a Healer’s Kit and taking the Healer feat."]},{"l":"Support","p":["A Support is someone who usually aids the team in buffs, debuffs, or skill checks, at the cost of being less effective at dealing damage. During combat, help to control the battlefield and make the battle go faster by helping teammates do their jobs better. Outside of combat, they assist in skill checks by usually having high modifiers in many skills, thus increasing chances of success. They might also be equipped with spells or items that give some mode of utility, such as invisibility or the ability to breath underwater.","This is most evident in the Bard, Rogue, and Artificer classes. The former two are also considered Skill Monkeys, due to their access to Expertise for some skills of their choice, making their chances of success almost guaranteed at high level.","If you want to increase your level of utility, consider taking feats such as Skilled, Skill Expert, Inspiring Leader, or Ritual Caster."]}],[{"l":"A Guide to Roleplaying","p":["Wri tten for the Dnd World Discord Server Unauthorised distribution is prohibited","Everything stated in this document is subjective and you can alter the techniques to suit your own preferences.

With that, I hope you will find this document useful and informative in your journey here at Dnd World."]},{"i":"so-what-is-rp","l":"So, what is RP?","p":["According to Google, it is to “act out or perform the part of a person or character”. You are simply leaving your OOC self behind to take the skin of a character! In the DW context, a lot of the action takes place in our wide array of RP channels, where players RP their characters going about their mundane life and their interactions with other characters. You imagine yourself as your character in that specific channel’s setting, and react to what’s going on around you as if you were your character, writing in third person format.","You also will need to RP during games, whether it is discussing tactics with your teammates, or interacting with NPCs your DM introduces. It can be as simple as pure dialogue and describing movement, or it can involve heart-wrenching character development that incorporates thoughts and motivations."]},{"i":"why-do-people-enjoy-rp","l":"Why do people enjoy RP?","p":["Roleplay is one of the three main pillars of D&D after all, alongside Combat and Exploration. D&D is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game (TTRPG), so if you’re playing D&D it's assumed that on some level you enjoy roleplaying, whether it's for a super-charged power fantasy all the way down to having an actual social life. The freeform ability to control exactly what your character says and does is one of the traits that differentiates D&D from your regular video game.","Fundamentally, people have fun living out the lives and experiences of a different person, and when you throw magic into the mix, fun shenanigans can occur. You might have fun playing an altruistic hero full of powers to balance out that in real life you are stuck in a corporate job, or play a huffy noble elf to poke fun at your friends when in real life you are the kindest person that could be. There are really many different ways to enjoy RP."]},{"l":"Being a responsible RPer","p":["However, you should remember that D&D is also a cooperative game. While part of the magic is that you aren’t interacting with computer generated NPCs with three dialogue options (two of which get you killed), it comes with the caveat that you are interacting with actual people. People who have feelings and who may not enjoy what you enjoy. Hence, it's important that you set boundaries and expectations.","In DW, we display our basic RP guidelines as part of our rules. Some crucial elements that we maintain for the fun of the greater community, as after all, your RP is all public and can be seen by people of all ages. One of the main banned topics is erotic role-playing (ERP) due to our family friendly environment. Partly because we have members as young as 13, and partly because the community at large has decided that we do not enjoy bleaching our eyes.","Other guidelines include asking for consent before casting spells on other characters or initiating player vs player (PVP) fights. The RP channels are considered a safe zone and some players may not be comfortable being beaten up by a character multiple levels above them, or having a memory crucial to their character modified."]},{"l":"Stay safe while RPing","p":["All rules are there for a reason and we have plenty of history behind each of the rules. For your own safety, do not initiate ERP with DW members in PMs or accept ERP requests from them. It is against the rules of DW to do so. If you receive such requests, please report them to FanMail or PM a mod if you would prefer privacy. Rest assured that your report will be taken seriously regardless whether the member(s) you are reporting are popular and/or a staff/admin.","You do not know the intentions of the people behind the screen nor their real ages. Screenshots from ERP scenes can be taken out of context and used against you. We do not want to ban people over a misunderstanding. Moreover, back before this rule, we had a history of ERP (thankfully long gone) quickly escalating into more severe matters such as soliciting nude pictures. It can get worse with stalking and blackmailing. In these cases, a violation of the Discord Terms of Service would have occurred and a formal report can be lodged. In the case of an underage victim, it will be considered a crime. Do not be a sexual predator."]},{"l":"Making a Character that works for RP"},{"l":"Race","p":["If you are a beginner RPer, I advise you not to start off with playing a race that explicitly has difficulty feeling emotions like Yuan-ti or Lizardfolk, despite the nice bonuses. That’s because naturally we as humans want to express emotions, so these races go against our intuitiveness and hence are more difficult to play. You might also want to try playing a race other than human if you are looking for flavor; elves and dwarves are chock full of it. Protip! Your race is beyond their bonuses. If they deviate from their race’s tendencies, they should have a reason for it."]},{"l":"Class","p":["This portion is you are going for an RP focused build. Some classes by nature are more RP-focused than others, although it’s possible to have good RP with any class. It’s just that some classes have abilities that feed your character’s RP potential, such as outfitting you with many skills/expertises and/or utility spells, enabling you to more easily take charge in social situations. In general, pure martial builds will have less to offer in RP situations as compared to spellcasters (with the exception of rogue)."]},{"l":"Backstory","p":["You don’t need to have a complex backstory to have fun in DW. In fact, some might advise that due to the multitude of DMs in DW, to keep your backstory vague. There’s a couple of reasons for that, first is to not burden whichever DM you end up with who may not be familiar with your backstory, and second is to keep your character’s goals unfulfilled as long as possible (more below). Due to the rotating nature of West Marches, it is quite possible that your backstory will never be touched on. Though there have been occasions where RP bounties are made specifically to involve characters’ backstories. Ideally, your backstory affects more of your character’s personality, whether instilling a positive attitude to the world as a result of loving parents or a grim, edgy killer from yet another orphan backstory. Protip: Don’t spill your backstory to the first person you meet at the tavern! If you’re just getting to know each other they probably aren’t interested in hearing your life story, and besides, you want to leave some mystery to your character."]},{"l":"Personality","p":["If you are fond of RP, you generally want to make your character have some form of social skills. It’s possible to pull off good RP with social awkwardness, but you risk acting out of character if you want to engage in more situations."]},{"i":"answering-the-unspoken-question-is-it-weird-to-play-a-character-of-a-different-gender-than-in-real-life","l":"Answering the unspoken question: Is it weird to play a character of a different gender than in real life?","p":["No! It is not. The main caveat is not to make it weird. Don’t make gender a restriction of what your character can do. You can try googling for writers’ guides for writing the genders, but well, it’s a fantasy setting, and you should not feel like your character is restricted by the societal developments of Earth and its cultures. Playing a different gender is less of a list of “Dos” and more of a list of “Don’ts”. You’ll be more or less on the right track with our rules in place, but mainly avoid playing into sexist stereotypes."]},{"l":"Initiating RP","p":["So you’ve got a character, but how are you going to approach someone to RP?

Now to determine if it’s suitable for you to join. Take a moment to observe the situation:","Do you know these people? If yes, consider how close you are to them and how past interactions have panned out in the past, and act accordingly to your character’s nature. If no, it depends on what they are doing. If they are just sitting around drinking, that’s usually good to join! If not, see the next question.","Are the people currently involved in an emotional and/or tense scene? Examples include confrontations, heated debates and proposals. If yes, then you should probably not join. If no, you are probably good to join. Having had a conversation once or twice is likely not grounds to interrupt an emotional scene."]},{"l":"There are no people currently RPing","p":["It’s time to see if you can convince someone to RP with you!

Beyond their appearance, how do the footfalls sound like, are they aggressively stomping leaving footprints on the road, a weary trudge through the mud, a nimble skip?","How does their hair look like? You can describe its length by long/short/medium, or you could talk about where it falls to, and how it frames the character’s face. What color is it? Does their hairstyle complement them with a elaborately styled do, or is it haphazard and choppy, clearly an amateur job done with a blade?","How much are they carrying on their backs? Does their packs look like they’re burdening them?","If they don’t have weapons, do they carry a staff or rod that gives away their spellcasting powers, or do they keep their wand up their sleeve?","Lastly, what expression do they have? Do they regard Snowhaven with wonder, for finally reaching their destination, or are they indifferent, regarding it just another stopover in their long lifespan? Do they look excited to meet new people, or are they just going with the crowd so as not to feel alone?","Since you only have one shot at introducing your character to the world (though you can always repeat this process albeit with less detail when meeting new people) you might as well make it count. Tell a story through their appearance. I tend to imagine how it would look like if a camera were to shoot the character as if they were making a dramatic entrance in a movie. The camera angles will usually focus on the most prominent parts of the character before showing their face. Such as:","The angles of their face: broad and square-jawed, soft and round, or narrow and sharp?","The camera moves up: what are they wearing? Flowing wizard robes or shining armor? A hooded cloak or a bright purple cape? Does their armor/clothing fit them or do they look like hand-me-downs? Does their clothing have any interesting details, such as holy symbols sewn into robes or encrusted gems?","The general approach is to go for a paragraph on appearance in #gates, however you may also do this in any other channel. The #drunken-yeti-tavern or any active channel will suffice, as you need people to bounce RP off of.","What color are their eyes? This one is especially prominent if they are a tiefling or aasimar or any races with notable differences. How do they perceive the world: are they constantly flitting around, accustomed to looking for the nearest danger, or relaxed and dreamy like that of a charlatan? How does this pair with the rest of their face: do cold eyes match a falsely warm smile?","What kind of posture do they carry themselves in? Hunched over, standing tall, a relaxed sashay?","What ornaments do they wear, if any? Amulets around the neck, dangling earrings, hair pins?","What race are they, and if they are an exotic race, how does the traits of their race present themselves? You can scatter these details throughout the description","You can mix and match the above pointers, omitting whichever you think is unnecessary and adding anything you can think of. If this is not your first time introducing your character, you can usually just keep the points for race+outfit+expression/mood.","You may take an interlude to describe if they have any weapons on them. What kind, and in what condition are they? Does the character keep one hand on the hilt at all times, or swagger about letting it swing in its sheath?","You might want to take the focus on hands to talk about skin texture: Is it pale and unmarred, or tan and leathery from the sun?

You might not think all these work for you or even believe this is good RP, so do what works for you!","Develop a memorable character Create a unique concept that differentiates them from the throngs of other characters. You can showcase this via a unique race-class combo, backstory, or personality. It need not necessarily be something no one has ever done before, as after all there have been so many games of D&D played. As long as you are able to remember them and want to play them again, that’s what matters. You can tailor their build to help you enforce a particular concept you are looking for.","Build off other people’s RP There are other people sharing the same environment as you, and it will be easier to have character development if your character builds relationships with those people. But in the same vein, having monologues on your own in a corner will lessen your chances of being approached by a friendly stranger. As you seek development in RP with other players, also show concern towards their own character, such as by asking questions. This will also enable you to keep the conversation going.","Have consistent characterisation This does not mean “this is what my character would do”, which is usually said as an excuse to antagonize another character or trouble the DM. This means sometimes taking the less ideal choice because you are thinking as that character. It also means giving any character development meaning.","When you end RP, leave the location Narcolepsy in the middle of the tavern, realistically without the PVP rules, would get you robbed. Specifying which location you head to will also help a character that is looking for you find you.","Continue finding ways to improve your RP I recommend reading more books in general to expand your vocabulary. It will also help your imagination in developing your character. Though, be careful not to develop “main character syndrome” as books tend to focus on a protagonist. Watch fight scenes from your favorite shows and observe the moves they do to dramaticize the act and make it interesting for the audience."]},{"l":"Styles of RP","p":["Most RP in DW can be broken down to four styles: Basic Form, Short Form, Medium Form and Long Form. Most RPers have a mix of all four styles for different occasions."]},{"l":"Basic Form","p":["Basic form is the most common type of RP encountered. It consists of a gesture: a small body movement that doesn’t involve them moving out of their space, along with a line of dialogue, or just dialogue. It is suitable for fast-paced settings such as the ever-popular #drunken-yeti-tavern or in combat. Generally most people settle into this form of RP after establishing their character’s presence.

It is best used in RP with just another person so that you aren’t interrupted mid-paragraph. It is not suitable for fast-paced settings such as combat unless you are able to quickly pre-type your turns while still reacting to changes in the battlefield.

You will likely be exploring this genre sparsely compared to the others because high tension events don’t occur that often. RPing a dramatic scene can be broken down to the 4 steps:","The Set up There should be a good reason for the drama to take place, whether its a confrontation of a long kept secret finally let out of the bag, some major revelation, a confession of feelings, or something else. Pick a good venue. Ideally move out of crowded channels such as the #drunken-yeti-tavern to somewhere quieter like a residence or Nature channel so you don’t get interrupted. A combat is not a good time to have such a scene so keep it to Medium length RP.","The Build Up Begin having some back and forth with your RP partner. Exposition of untold events, releasing inner feelings, generally waiting for a good moment to move to the next stage. The important thing is to keep the momentum going. You can pad the build up with questioning where it makes sense. Be sure to add plenty of gesticulating and other actions that interact with the environment like sinking to their knees or kicking an innocent stalagmite. If you’re on your own, you’re gonna have to do an internal monologue. What you can do to make it less monotonous is pan in to the character’s feelings, pan out to how their expression changes, pan back in, pan out to show how they start interacting with the environment due to their feelings, and so on.","The Climax Ah, the climax. For this part, you want to keep it short and punchy unlike the build up. Focus on delivering smarter wordplay by carefully analysing what the other party is saying. Keep sentences short to allow a faster exchange: this simulates speaking quicker in a text based environment. Ideally, move onto the Resolution when you or the other person get a good, indisputable line in.","If you’re on your own, this is the time where you cut off the monologue, and interact with the DM’s NPC/Monster (if applicable) or start doing something drastic, like burning all your books or writing an angry letter of retribution.","The Resolution An angry storming off, a comforting hug, or something else are all examples of a resolution. This dictates the tone of how the scene ends. If it ends on a good note, it’ll likely be a wholesome reconciliation scene full of hugging, tears, and gifts to curry forgiveness. A natural ending point would be when you either run out of things to say and settle into peaceful silence or one party has to leave. If it ends on a bad note, you might just skip this stage altogether and end the scene with the characters reacting in private to the incident."]},{"l":"Example","p":["[Build up] Elicia: \"...that's sugar you know?\"[Build up properly begins as parties begin interacting.

But roleplaying romances comes with a sort of commitment as well, although much less than its real life counterpart. Hence, before I get into discussing actual RP tips, I should first give you some warnings:","Don’t attach yourself to the first person you meet at the tavern! As the saying goes, there are a lot of fish in the sea! Have a look around first before settling, it will save you from IC break up drama (unless you are looking for that).","Know the activity of the other party Ideally the player(s) of your character’s romantic interest are of similar activity as yours, and online around the same time. Romances have ended due to one party not being able to see the other as often due to OOC reasons.","Be mindful of the level gap Level gaps have also disturbed romances because the couple will never be able to adventure together and the power gap may cause the lower levelled party to feel insecure. It’s possible to have a good romance even with a level gap but be aware of this potential issue!","Mind the PDA You’ll be restricted from the nastier things by our rules, but cuddling too much or making weird sounds can make the people around you uncomfortable (just like in real life!), not to mention its not something they can build off on (remember #2 of General RP Tips). So avoid doing that in public channels.","Going onto actual romance RP tips, you generally want to showcase a slower relationship development or you’re going to run out of material very quickly. Be sure to continue to develop your character beyond interactions with their partner, so that you will have stories to tell each other, and also because a character that can stand on their own feet safeguards you from losing the purpose of your character in the event your significant other dies."]},{"l":"Example","p":["She considers many things--and under the new lens of morals imposed upon her, she sees...that this isn't...too bad perhaps.

There are usually a couple of reasons for this:","The players of the characters who your character interacted with regularly have gone inactive. There is quite little you can do about this except move on and find new players to RP with. Reminisce the past, but keep an open mind for new opportunities","A new, more fun and exciting concept has entered your head Speaking as someone who has watched countless players cycle out concept after concept, I can confidently tell you that there will always be something more fun and exciting out there, because the excitement of getting a new thing often trumps the old. The rebuilding/retiring rules allow you to cycle out concepts, so there’s less of a risk of you getting caught in a concept you don’t like. However, retiring will still cause you to lose progress, not to mention the loss of character relationships. Hence, I advise that you give it a good thought before you start on a new concept. Play a character that you are invested in and will have fun playing with long-term, that you think you can keep RPing, beyond the calculation of their DPS or AC or attack bonus. As such, I would advise you to avoid making meme characters, because that kind of fun is usually short-lived once you’ve tired of their gimmick.","Your character has accomplished all their goals and you don’t see any reason for them to continue adventuring. Ideally, you want to have several goals that your character wants to accomplish. The reason being that if you accomplish the one and only goal your character has, you can quickly find yourself losing interest and meaning in RPing that character. For example, you can have one goal from your backstory, like avenging your parents’ deaths. Then you have another you gain along the way through quests, like finding the truth to a BBEG. And finally you have one that you develop on your own, such as keeping your friends safe after your character witnesses a death in the party."]},{"l":"Tips to prevent RP burnout","p":["Take a break By far the easiest and most effective way is to take a step back. You can try RPing a different character or step away from RPing altogether if you are starting to feel like RP is losing its luster. It may take time to rejuvenate the joy you used to feel after doing it too much. In the meantime you can chat in general or if you’re a staff, focus on staff work, and when you start to miss RPing, you can jump back in","Interact with new people Expanding your social circle is especially important in DW where people often come and go. With the passage of time, it can be hard to maintain relationships. Continuously interacting with the newer generations will prevent you from feeling out of touch with the community.","Have a good balance of IRL and online Doing too much of anything will make anyone feel queasy. Especially if you are a younger member of the server, there might be more important things in life that you need to focus on. Making sure you are not falling behind in terms of school, work, or IRL relationships. Maintaining a healthy balance will keep the hobby sustainable. It’s important to maintain your IRL friendships as your DW friends are limited by the fact that they’re online and can’t physically help you.

It will simply be for inter-player roleplay opportunities."]},{"l":"The World Stays Mostly Consistent","p":["Depending on the bounty content, your character can save the world from a powerful lich or stop a dragon from terrorizing villagers. This is not what this is referring to. This is referring to those who might want to overthrow the Senate within Snowhaven, or become a demigod.","In general, achieving personal character goals that involve changing the setting is very rare. This is related to the point above about backstory. In addition, a part of the appeal of the server is the drop in and out style, and that relies on keeping the setting relatively consistent."]},{"l":"Game Plots are Self Contained","p":["Occasionally, there will be interlinked story content, and those will be posted in #world-events. However, these function more like arcs and less like major overarching story plot. This is because the server is designed to have consistent play, and having an end goal defeats the purpose of the server."]},{"l":"Different Playstyles","p":["In a regular campaign or small server, the DM might interview players to ensure all players have similar playstyles. On this server however, we accept people from many backgrounds in order to be as accommodating as possible. This means you will have to make compromises when it comes to playing with other people with different styles from you.","In general, if you find that you do not mesh well with a certain player or character, you can either talk out these concerns with that player, or simply avoid them. However, if you feel like a rule has been breached or a line has been crossed, you should file a report to the FanMail bot and we will investigate accordingly."]},{"l":"Staff Hierarchy","p":["Dnd World functions on a linear staff hierarchy. This means that almost every staff member has a limit on what they can do. Please address your concerns to the correct channels (see section on PMing) so that they can be addressed. Don’t complain to staff in public channels, especially lower ranking staff like Bookkeeping Assistants. They can’t enact changes to the system. Submit complaints to FanMail. Don’t ping or PM admins. See sections about them above. DMs, while being the main arbiter during games, are subject to guidelines by Mentors and Seniors. So don’t take it out on them if you are not satisfied with xp or gold given."]},{"l":"Changes Take Time","p":["Even if you submit a reasonable suggestion in #server-suggestions, it may still take time to implement. Usually this can take 3 months, maybe even half a year. This is because we are often already working on a lot of projects, and have to prioritize. Suggestions need to be processed, meetings need to be deliberated over, and someone needs to sit down and make things happen. These factors make project developments take a long time."]},{"l":"There is Much More to Do Outside Games","p":["Unlike campaigns, when you can only play when games are happening, there are all sorts of activities that you can do to further your experience.

It is also about your newbie members who are getting their first impression of the server through your guild, the active players who commit themselves to your guild through donations, and the staff who support your guild from its creation to handling all your processing needs.

Impulsively creating a guild, while fun, will hit you as soon as Monday rolls around and you find you are too swamped with work to manage it at all.","Appoint representatives to do smaller-scale work like accounting and recruitment","Prepay your taxes in advance.
