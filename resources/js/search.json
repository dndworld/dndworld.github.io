In exchange, you are able to use large-scale, named entities that are not possible with Basic backstories.","Robert was a captain in the Taffeta war, fighting for the Rebels to remove the usurper Pickering Geminition from the throne. One day before a routine patrol, he injures his leg and ends up staying behind. As it so happens, the next day the Braveheart line falls and the Rebels end up overrun by enemy forces. His entire squad is slaughtered, but Robert manages to escape. As the Rebel forces gradually diminishes in power, Robert is forced to find a new purpose in life."]},{"l":"Level 1 Character in a Collaborative Story","p":["What you did in your backstory must make sense for a Level 1 character's capabilities.

They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections. Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer."]},{"l":"Barbarian","p":["People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature– keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.","Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise."]},{"l":"Bard","p":["In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.","The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatant destruction. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge."]},{"l":"Cleric","p":["Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don't grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.","Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity's wishes.","Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from the heavens to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side."]},{"l":"Druid","p":["Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.","Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form."]},{"l":"Fighter","p":["Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike."]},{"l":"Monk","p":["Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes."]},{"l":"Paladin","p":["A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin's power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god. Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice."]},{"l":"Ranger","p":["Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes. Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature's power, much as a druid does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger's talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands."]},{"l":"Rogue","p":["Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.","When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities."]},{"l":"Sorcerer","p":["Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.","The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.","Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power."]},{"l":"Warlock","p":["A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.","The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons."]},{"l":"Wizard","p":["Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.","Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic."]}],[{"l":"After Creating Your Character","p":["Once you've created your character sheet, and imported them in , have a look at the following tabs:"]},{"i":"ready-to-finish-setting-up-your-character-on-the-server-and-get-started","l":"Ready to finish setting up your character on the server and get started?","p":["How to Start Playing"]},{"i":"want-to-learn-how-to-earn-xp-on-the-server","l":"Want to learn how to earn XP on the server?","p":["How to Earn XP"]}],[{"i":"whats-next","l":"What's Next?","p":["This page is to teach you what to do after creating your character.

However, D&D games are hosted by a human (the DM) who has to plan their life around their hobby, thus it is subject to availability.

Depending on the season, you could play one game every couple of weeks, or if you're lucky, a couple times every week."]},{"l":"Games Take a Long Time","p":["Games that are designed to be short such as arenas and pits typically take around 2 hours.

These rules attempt to accommodate the potentially limitless possibilities within D&D. In addition, over the years, dozens of books have been released to expand on what you can do with the game.","As such, a lot of the game requires reading. We recommend you start with our New to D&D guide. Please ask questions in , as this is the easiest way to clarify what you are unsure about and prevent rule breaking."]},{"l":"Games Emphasize Teamwork","p":["In single player games, you have more flexibility to play how you want, and you can go off and make reckless choices like killing a villager just to see the consequences.","In D&D, being a lone wolf is a generally ineffective strategy and will likely lead to disappointment. Much of Dnd World relies on interplayer roleplay outside games. In addition, taking the most chaotic path for no reason other than for seeing the world burn is generally frowned upon and is termed “Chaotic Stupid”. This is because this derails the session that the DM has painstakingly crafted, and affects the experience of your teammates who may want to play seriously.","This is not to say you cannot have shenanigans. You just have to use your judgment to determine when is the time for it. Befriending the villager or the \"misunderstood\" villain? Go ahead! Taking an impromptu shopping trip with said villager, or trying to befriend the mindless mummy screaming death in your face? Probably a bad call that stalls the experience for everyone else.","As a rule of thumb, if the game is approaching the 8th hour and someone is already commenting they need to sleep soon, now is a good time to wrap things up and not a good time to try antics."]},{"l":"Time is Wonky","p":["In most video games, progression is in real time. This is also true for our roleplay channels. However, in combat, time is usually handwaved or dictated by the DM. This is because D&D is designed such that a round (where everyone gets a turn) lasts 6 seconds. 10 rounds is a full minute.","Yet, in real life, each turn usually takes a couple of minutes, and a round can last an hour or more. D&D battles also usually don’t hit the 10 round mark.

Intimidation can be used to goad enemies or make them stand down, while crowd control spells also allow you to incapacitate creatures without killing them."]},{"l":"Character Roles","p":["Within multiplayer games are the subset of character roles. Not every role can be fully recreated within D&D's design, but understanding the basic concept can help you build your character.","It should be noted that with how many subclasses and feats have been released since D&D 5e’s original publication, every class can be built to fulfill tankiness, damage, or support roles. Some are just designed to do it better than others; others can only accomplish it with specific builds. This guide is just to give you a broad simplified overview.","Contents:","Tank","DPS","Summoner","Healer","Support"]},{"l":"Tank","p":["A tank is someone with a lot of health, designed to take the brunt of enemy damage. This role relies on good positioning and builds that aggro enemies as well as punishes them for attacking teammates. This is best displayed in the Barbarian class, as well as Fighter class to a slightly less extent.","To maximize tankiness, sink your highest stats into Constitution, in order to increase your Hit Points(HP). This will increase the amount of damage you can take. At higher levels, you can also take feats that increase your health, such as Tough.","Also be sure to increase your Armor Class(AC) as much as possible. This determines the minimum roll needed to hit you, and the higher the better. AC depends on two things: your Dexterity score and the armor you are wearing (determined by your class and affordability).","Dexterity determines how agile you are and in turn how hard you are to hit. As with Constitution, the higher the stat you allocate for this, the better. Your Dexterity modifier (not to be confused with score) is added to your base armor to give your final AC. For example, if you are wearing Leather armor, and you have a Dexterity score of 14, your AC is","11 [Base Armor for Leather] +2 [Dexterity modifier] =13","Classes designed to be tanky such as Barbarian and Fighter will give you access to medium or heavy armor, which allows you to have higher AC. Barbarian also has Unarmored Defense, which allows you to forgo armor and instead only use your Dexterity modifier. As you level and save more money, you will also be able to afford more expensive armor, which will increase your AC.","In D&D, it isn't enough for a tank to just stand there and wait for enemies to attack them. Enemies will usually target those they perceive as a threat, which often includes the squishy spellcasters standing in the backline. There is a reason wizards as known for being the first to die.","As such, in order to be effective, Tanks must be a threat. That means not ignoring your damage output, and more importantly, your positioning. Where you are on the map is extremely important, and you should aim to place yourself up front next to as many monsters as possible.","That way, if monsters want to attack your backline, they will have to take an Attack of Opportunity from you. If paired with feats like Sentinel or Polearm Master, this can greatly cripple your enemies' mobility.","In summary, traditional Tanks don't exist in D&D. Instead, they focus on defending the party, rather than just blindly taking damage. Thus, they may also be called Defenders. This concept is explained more ."]},{"l":"DPS","p":["A DPS is someone who does a lot of damage but sacrifices other aspects such as health and utility. This role relies on good movement as well as builds that have both reliable damage and features/spells that mitigates hits. Although many classes in D&D fit this category, it is most prominent within the Fighter, Rogue, Monk, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard.","To maximize your damage, be sure to sink your highest stats into the stat you use to attack. For Rogues and Monks, this is Dexterity, and for spellcasters, this is referred to as your casting stat and defers by class.","It should be noted not all spells, feats, or subclasses are created equal. Some are more situational than others. If being effective in combat is very important to you, you are advised to research and discuss with other players plans for your build."]},{"i":"subtype-glass-cannons","l":"Subtype: Glass Cannons","p":["Wizard deserves a special mention for the fact that they are the prime example of a Glass Cannon. Their d6 hit die paired with no bonus to constitution saves (unlike the Sorcerer) makes them susceptible to both weapons and spells. However, at higher levels, they gain more and more abilities to counter their enemies. They can increase their toolbox by researching new spells, and eventually gain powerful spells like Force Cage that completely shut down their enemies."]},{"i":"subtype-gish-builds","l":"Subtype: Gish Builds","p":["Gish builds allow you to both attack with weapons and cast spells. Some base classes already allow you to do this, known as half-casters (e.g. Ranger, Paladin, Spellsword (Homebrew), and the Wizard Bladesinger subclass). However, Gish builds' potency are often optimized through multiclassing, e.g. Sorcadins (Paladin/Sorcerer).","Gishes trade greater utility in exchange for being within the heat of combat. As such, it is important that you invest in Constitution and Dexterity so that you do not suffer from being in melee range."]},{"i":"subtype-grappler-builds","l":"Subtype: Grappler Builds","p":["If you like getting up and close, D&D has a ridiculous number of ways you can build grapplers: melee warriors who specialize in pinning enemies and pummeling them.","Some common builds include the Grappler feat paired with the Fighter's Runeknight subclass or the Barbarian's Path of the Giant subclass. However, the trade-off is that you can't escape danger (such as a stray Fireball) easily, and out of game this leaves you with little utility.","Some classes have access to spells that dole out Area of Effect (AOE) damage. AOE damage affects all creatures standing within a certain area as designated by the spell.","D&D has friendly fire, and you can harm your teammates if you do not position your spells properly. In worst case scenarios, especially for a specific spell called Fireball, this can cause your teammates to die.","As such, it is important that you communicate with your teammates on the turn before you unleash a high damage AOE spell in an area they are standing on. This is such that they can move out of the way, or if they can’t, you should reconsider the spell you are using."]},{"l":"Summoner","p":["A Summoner is someone who summons multiple creatures in order to divide the attention of enemies, giving the party more room to attack the enemies. Creatures can usually attack enemies themselves, and are controlled by the player. This role relies on maintaining concentration of the spell while also making use of positioning.","D&D’s initiative system means that each creature summoned has to perform actions separately, and even if creatures are grouped, due to their numerous nature, they usually take time to act. As such, it can make combat grind to a halt.","That said, if you really want to play a summoner, the Druid or Wizard's Conjuration subclass is the best example of this, as it gives you access to most spells that start with “Conjure” or “Summon”. To a lesser extent, Ranger also gives you access to “Conjure Animals”, the lowest level and most commonly used summoning spell. The Ranger subclass Beast Master also gives you access to an animal companion at 3rd level.","This build really only comes online at higher levels once you have unlocked spells that allow you to summon creatures. Even then, for practicality reasons, most summoners choose to limit their number of active summons, as it usually clogs up the flow of combat for little benefit.","For summoners, as your ability to maintain concentration is extremely important, you may consider taking feats such as War Caster or Resilient: Constitution. It is important to position yourself as far back as possible to minimize the chances of taking damage and breaking concentration."]},{"l":"Healer","p":["A Healer is someone whose main ability is keeping their team alive. As with most games, Healers tend to be few in number and are thus higher in demand.","D&D does not have any classes that are designed to only heal. Healers can usually do other things which overlaps with the DPS or Support category. That said, classes that are best at healing are the Cleric(specifically Life Cleric), Bard, and Druid.","Some classes or subclasses have features that provide small amounts of healing. These are usually called \"Backup Healers\" and are found within the Paladin and Ranger classes as well as the Celestial Warlock, Divine Soul Sorcerer, Alchemist Artificer and Way of Mercy Monk subclasses.","However, as the amount of healing is small and usually come as a sacrifice for other abilities, it is recommended that each party has a designated healer and the backup is reserved for when the main healer is down, preoccupied, or out of resources.","It is possible to play those classes and not be a healer. Case in point, if you play Bard but do not pick any healing spells like Healing Word or Cure Wounds, you would simply be a DPS or Support class. However, it is recommended that you pick at least one healing spell if you play those classes, as people tend to account for some mode of backup healing if you are part of the party.","It is important to note that D&D is designed in such a way that it is much more effective to deal out damage (hence stopping the source of the threat) as compared to healing damage taken. As such, you should consider timing heals for teammates at low health or when they are unconscious. Keep in mind that spell slots (and in turn healing) are limited and should be conserved.","If you want to do some healing but your class does not have healing abilities, consider purchasing a Healer’s Kit and taking the Healer feat."]},{"l":"Support","p":["A Support is someone who usually aids the team in buffs, debuffs, or skill checks, at the cost of being less effective at dealing damage. During combat, they help to control the battlefield and speed up combat by helping teammates do their jobs better. Supports have some overlap with Healers, and many characters serve both roles.","There are a few main ways Supports help within combat:","Area Denial/Battlefield Control: This involves limiting the area on the map your enemies can move through without risking damage, greatly kneecapping their mobility. Druids are excellent with this, with access to spells like Moonbeam, Spike Growth and Plant Growth. Other spells like Fog Cloud, Black Tentacles and Wall of Force are also deceptively powerful.","Crowd Control: This involves incapacitating or severely debuffing enemies. In the beginning, this can be achieved through spells such as Sleep or Hold Person. As you level up, you will have access to more powerful crowd control (CC) spells, such as Hypnotic Pattern, Slow, and Banishment. Wizards get access to wicked powerful CC spells at high levels.","Outside of combat, they assist in skill checks by usually having high modifiers in many skills, thus increasing chances of success. They might also be equipped with spells or items that give some mode of utility, such as invisibility or the ability to breath underwater.","This is most evident in the Bard, Rogue, and Artificer classes. The former two are also considered Skill Monkeys, due to their access to Expertise for some skills of their choice, making their chances of success almost guaranteed at high level. This can be further expanded by taking feats such as Skilled, Skill Expert, Inspiring Leader, or Ritual Caster."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["And that's about it! To be sure, there are definitely niche subtypes that were skipped over, but we hope we covered all the main ones.
