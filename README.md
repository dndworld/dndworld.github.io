# Dnd World Guide

This is the repository for the DW Guide site, [hosted here on GitHub Pages](https:/dndworld.github.io/).

## Mission Statement

Broadly, the GitHub documentation seeks to **make information easier to digest for new members.** It does so by:

1. Improving formatting: Discord notably lacks a native wiki system to present chunks of information, which can result in text walls, back-and-forth channel switching, multiple clicks (especially for pins) and generally increase the barrier to get a piece of information. This is mitigated by Retype’s elements, which provides different ways to highlight information according to importance.
2. Improving documentation: Collating obscure but important information into one place, which might otherwise be lost in a chat log or pin. It seeks to prevent misinformation or conflicting rulings by codifying statements made by admins.

## Contributing

We highly encourage you to submit possible improvements using the [Issues](https://github.com/dndworld/dwguide/issues) tracker. You can also use [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506014883217419), though we prefer GitHub because it allows us to better track issues, ensuring that they don’t get lost.

While GitHub may seem intimidating, everything here is formatted using Markdown, which is the same system used by Discord! If you know Discord formatting, you can contribute too!

We have some tutorials for how to draft changes to the source code and suggest them on GitHub. You will need to [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already. You will want to use a desktop or laptop too. [Then check the developer docs](https:/dndworld.github.io/docs/).

By-design, we exclude certain information from the guide:

1. Pins of quick references, such lists of commands, house rules, and common mistakes. It defeats the purpose if users are redirected to an external site. However, some pins can contain important information that is not written down elsewhere: please submit these for consideration.
2. Rulings that only to apply to one specific use case. For example, rulings through #rulings-questions or FanMail. However, if there have been repeated questions, it may be worth adding to the rulings doc.

## Why?

Based on surveys, a common sentiment is that the server has too many channels. This is a problem mainly caused by two unavoidable factors:

1. D&D, as a game published in book form, fundamentally requires a lot of reading.
2. DW is a text-based server, which means that it primarily communicates information through text channels

The GitHub seeks to balance two main conflicting interests:

1. User-friendliness, necessary for Newbies who are unfamiliar with the server layout and etiquette. 
   - New players are generally susceptible to information overload, especially for those new to D&D who have to learn both game and server rules.
   - This has resulted in condensation and chunking/fragmentation to reduce the amount of necessary reading, but can increase ambiguity and cause more confusion, resulting in more questions being asked
2. Accessibility of information, necessary for Active Players and Staff, who often rely on precedence to know whether something is allowed on the server.
   - Active Players and Staff generally want to better understand the limits of the server, in particular Mods who have to enforce those limits.
   - This has resulted in rulings being gradually added since 2018, especially to address niche issues and oversights. However, because this information is generally tacked on over time, it may appear disorganised or suffer from bloat.

In summary, this project acknowledges the need to address niche topics in a game as complex as D&D, while also ensuring new players are only reading what is absolutely necessary for them to get started.
