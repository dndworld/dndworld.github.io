# Avrae Commands

Avrae is our virtual dice bot that we use to make all dice rolls on the server. This page lists the most commonly used Avrae commands along with a few examples.

For the complete list of the commands, visit [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://avrae.io/commands/).

- `!help`: sends you a full list of commands to PM.

- Our partner server The Starry Shore have created [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="The Ultimate Avrae Bot Tutorial"](https://youtu.be/im0vDcYFIbI), a short YouTube video to help with some basic Avrae commands.
