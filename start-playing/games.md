# Joining Games & Earning XP

This guide explains different ways of gaining XP on the server.

## Overview

There are four main ways of earning XP:

1. [RPXP](#1-rpxp) (transferred later as XP)
2. [Combat Training DTD](#2-combat-training-dtd)
3. [DM Events](#3-dm-events)
4. [Avrae Tutorial XP](#4-avrae-tutorial-xp)

## 1. RPXP

RPXP is separate from XP, but can be converted to XP after attending DM events. More info can be found below.

You can earn RPXP by roleplaying with other players for half an hour or more in a RP channel. It is the most reliable way to gain XP, as you can stack up RPXP outside events and convert it to XP after each DM event.

### RPXP Rules

#### Active RP
RPXP can only be added for **active RP.** Players are required to interact with other player(s) in a meaningful and engaged way, such that a reasonable person could tell they are actively RPing (and not, say, sending a few words over the course of 3 hours to farm RPXP).

As a rule of thumb, there should be no more than ≈30 mins between your own messages in a normal- or fast-paced setting such as the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#drunken-yeti-inn"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/551901424276078602).
- If the players involved are replying with long, multi-paragraph messages, some flexibility is allowed.

It is NOT considered active RP if a player's only contribution to a session is a few gestures or words, such as *they take a sip from their mug* or *they nod in agreement*.
- If there are unreasonably large gaps of time between messages, Mods may rule that this is not considered active RP.

#### Tracking & Logging
- RPXP is tracked separately for each character you have. 
- If you are RPing more than one character at the same time, you can only gain RPXP for one of them during that period.
- All changes to RPXP must be made in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#xp-tracker"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531014104098537481)
- If you are in the middle of RPing, you don't need to use the :octagonal_sign: react when switching channels.

#### DM Events & Redeeming
- RPXP can be transferred to the character's XP total, only **AFTER** the character has completed a DM sanctioned event.
- Transferring RPXP to XP after a DM event does **not** reset the weekly cap.
- After attending a DM event, you **must** add any RPXP you have.
- You cannot log and gain RPXP from DM Events.

#### Misc.
- If you forget to react to mark the start and end of the RP but it is still within 24 hours since it ended, you can still mark them and gain RPXP retroactively.
- It is considered “cheating”, to add more RPXP than you should, add invalid RPXP, or add RPXP to your main XP tracker without a DM event, etc., and it results in the same consequences as any other cheating behaviors, according to its severity.

#### Spar RP
You can spar (PvP) with other players in the snowhaven-arena or snowhaven-arena-2 for the same amount of RPXP as RPing. Arena is a safe place to fight, as death is not permanent due to the healing constructs being on stand-by. For any other PvP, please refer to section 2.4 of rules.

#### Time Bubbled RP
The server runs in real time, but sometimes, real life stops a RP from being completed. You are allowed to pause to continue this RP in what we call a Time Bubble. 

Time bubble RPs exist out of the server's time. You can still earn RPXP for them following the RPXP rules.

### Step By Step Guide for RPXP

#### Gaining RPXP

1) When you begin roleplaying, react to your first post with :beginner: `:beginner:` and get the person you are RPing with to react as well.

2) When you stop roleplaying, react to your last post with :octagonal_sign: `:stop:` and get the person you are RPing with to react as well.

3) Find out how long the RP session was. You can find your :beginner: and :octagonal_sign: messages posted to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rp-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/592249450789863434).

4) Log RPXP in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#xp-tracker"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531014104098537481).
> You can get RPXP for each **half hour** of active RP, rounded down.
> 
> ```
> !rpxp <hour> [message]
> ```
> 
> Example: `!rpxp 1.5 "#the-library"`

5) Weekly RPXP Cap
There is maximum RPXP you can gain each week (See the table below).

All RPXP counters reset at 12AM EST Monday. Run the following command in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#xp-tracker"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531014104098537481) at the start of each week to reset it.

```
!rpxp cap reset
```

**RPXP Rate & Weekly Cap**

The following table is how much RPXP per hour you can gain depending on your level. You can pull up this information by running `!rpxp cap`.

- You can get RPXP for each __half hour__ of active RP, rounded down.

**Transferring RPXP to XP**

> See under [DM Events](#3-dm-events) section below.

**RPXP Claim**

> If it has been 1 month since your character's last DM-sanctioned event, or since you imported your character, you can claim their RPXP as XP by submitting the form in [!badge icon="mark-github" variant="dark" text="Claims"](/records/claims/).
> 
> The 1-month timer resets once the claim is processed.


## 2. Combat Training DTD

Combat Training DTD provides a small amount of XP depending on success rate.

1. Set up the Lifestyle
> In order to do Downtime Days (DTD) activities, you must first pay the lifestyle cost. 
> 
> Please check out the [!badge icon="mark-github" variant="dark" text="Lifestyle rules"](/downtime-and-lifestyle/lifestyle/) for more details and how to set up your lifestyle.

2. Do the Combat Training
> Note that combat training has a cost of 1gp per character level. This is automatically deducted from the coin purse when you use the `!train` alias.
> 
> In [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#dtd-automated-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/579777361117970465), run the following command.
> 
> ```
> !train
> ```
> 
> The full explanation of Combat Training DTD can be found in [!badge icon="mark-github" variant="dark" text="Lifestyle rules"](/downtime-and-lifestyle/lifestyle/), and the command description and argument options can be found by running `!help train` in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#bot-dump"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/519131071502221313). You can do 1 DTD per day, up to 5 per week.

3. Log the XP
> Go to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#xp-tracker"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531014104098537481) and log the XP
> 
> ```
> !dxp train <amount>
> ```

Some guild modules and aides may provide bonus to the combat training DTD. For more information, please refer to the pinned messages of each guild’s channel.

You **cannot** transfer RPXP to XP with combat training. This can only be done after the character has participated in a DM sanctioned event.


## 3. DM Events

You can gain XP by participating in DM events. A DM event, or a DM sanctioned event is an event that is overseen by a DM (Dungeon Master), or AM (Arena Master). Below are the types of DM events on this server, roughly in order of frequency. 

For how to sign up for DM events, please refer to “Signing up for DM events” in [How to Start Playing](start-playing/#signing-up-for-dm-events)

## 4. Avrae Tutorial XP

You can earn Avrae Tutorial XP by roleplaying with other players for at least half an hour in the one of the Arena channels or threads. It is a way to learn Avrae commands and encourage sparring among new players. 

Following rules apply to Avrae Tutorials:
- There's a maximum limit of 6 Avrae Tutorials **per character**.
- Avrae Tutorial XP tracked separately for each character you have. 
- If you are RPing more than one character at the same time, you can only gain Avrae Tutorial XP for one of them during that period.
- All modification of XP must be made in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#xp-tracker"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/531014104098537481)
- XP can only be redeemed for **active** spars between players. These spars should use Avrae's initiative tracker and involve multiple attacks, skill checks, etc. It's considered cheating to redeem Avrae Tutorial XP when you've only sent 2 messages, for example.
- You can gain Avrae Tutorial XP and RPXP at the same time.

<br>

- You cannot log and gain Avrae Tutorial XP from DM Events.

<br>

- If you forget the reactions to mark the beginning and end of the RP, you can still mark them afterwards and gain the Avrae Tutorial XP retroactively, as long as it is within 24 hours since you ended the RP.
- It is considered “cheating” to add more XP than you should, add invalid XP, etc., and it results in the same consequences as any other cheating behaviors, according to its severity.

### Step By Step Guide for Avrae Tutorial XP
