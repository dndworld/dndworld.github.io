## Roleplay and Game Rules

==- 1. **Follow the rules of the game.**
This includes:
- DnD 5e ruleset
<https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules>
- Server’s rule adjustments and variant rules
  - [`#severratas`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/775917313207173150)
  - DnD World Content Errata/Variant Feature Document
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZcayuhX0mTNasDS3n3hUpjLj07fngXl9IMzLCtCvA_U/edit> 
- Table rules your DM is using for their games
==- 2. **Do not invent lore.**
You or your characters should not imply the existence of any influential new locations, organizations, entities, NPCs, events, items, etc. which are not already established in the server. 

Characters should not reference elements from outside the server's setting, such as other D&D realms like Faerûn, IRL countries, or any media franchise.
==- 3. **Your RP should not make others uncomfortable.**
This includes harassment, intimidation, extortion, hate speech, excessive public displays of affection, behaving like a child, adopting other PCs, yelling or screeching constantly, or other behavior that weirds people out or makes it difficult for others to enjoy RP.
==- 4. **PvP Rules.** 
PvP is allowed with consent and following the stipulated rules.

**4.1. All parties involved must consent.**
In general, PvP checks and attacks in RP are not permitted or effective without OOC consent from all parties involved.

Without such consent, other players are free to disregard the results of such checks entirely. 

This includes examples such as spells, attacks, intimidation, deception (against insight), or stealth (against perception).

**4.1.1. Telling lies in RP**
When deceiving other characters, you must clarify OOC that your character is lying, in order to prevent misinformation.

**4.2. Limitations of PvP**
- No stealing is allowed, even with OOC consent.
- Player-vs-Player fights are allowed, but only with consent and in an appropriate location.
  - Friendly spars may take place in [`#snowhaven-arena`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/524265517830242304) or [`#snowhaven-arena-2`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/586365553418043392). 
  - Fighting in any other place including [`#gladiator-pit`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/553741559431168030) must follow the rules of the [PvP document (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sOWEJMqXdpRejXRonx1iMhwZsJjN9vHZ-jYQdPJbUeo/).
- Summoned creatures cannot participate in PvP without their summoner present.
==- 5. **Don’t be a rules lawyer.**
When in DM events, DM has the final say with rulings. 

Sometimes rules are bent for the sake of better storytelling and flow. Some DMs have House Rules pinned in their channel, which might differ from the usual rules. People make mistakes, but if it doesn’t make a huge impact on the game, it is entirely up to the DM to make an adjustment or let it go. 

You may point out rules as you understand them in the appropriate OOC channel if you feel something was left out and it really matters to you. However, stubbornly arguing the precise interpretation of game rules with your DM negatively impacts the gameplay experience, and should be avoided. If the issue is severe enough to make a report, please send a `@-FanMail-` to file an official complaint.
==- 6. **Don’t metagame.**
**Metagaming** means using OOC knowledge to give yourself an IC advantage. 

Examples include:
- Looking up monster stats
- Using prior OOC knowledge to judge creature abilities, disregarding what your character knows
- Asking another player in ooc for an action such as healing, when it should be handled in IC.
- Taking advantage of DM mistakes, such as reading notes that are clearly not meant for the players in gsheet maps even if they are left there by mistake, viewing sheet modification history, etc.
==- 7. **Use Proper RP format.**
- Narration: italics `* *` 
  - e.g. *The dragonborn walks in.*
- Character speech: quotations `" "` 
  - e.g. "T'is stuffy in here."
- Thoughts and languages other than Common: spoiler tags `|| ||`
  - e.g. (Draconic)||He wishes he hadn't come.||
- OOC comments: parentheses `( )` 
  - e.g. (What does he see?)
- Roleplaying a summoned creature without its summoner present: (Summon) <roleplay>
  - e.g. (Summon) [Draconic] "||Watch yourself,||" *the drake snarls.*
- Please do not use Discord's headers format for RP.

- Please do not use Avrae's `embed` functionality for RP purposes, as this may give an impression of piloting an NPC.
==- 8. **Character Rebuild and Retire**
Follow the instructions in the [`#rebuild-retire-log`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946) channel pins for the character rebuild and retire. 
You should not delete a character without going through the proper process.

It is prohibited to kill off your character intentionally for the purpose of retiring the character.
==- 9. **Don’t set your own checks or DCs.**
You may use dice rolls as a tool for RP improvisation. However, you cannot set a pass/fail DC for skill checks, tool checks, knowledge checks, or any actions against NPCs such as theft, persuasion, attacks, etc.
==- 10. **Multiple signups for DM events**
You may sign up to multiple DM events. However, once a character is accepted to an event, all other signups __with that character__ need to be removed.

After a DM event, if you have sign-ups for other events, make sure to update the "last event" date.
==- 11. **Only one character per player may sign up for each DM event.**
==- 12. **Do not multitask during a DM event.**
When participating in a DM event, you are expected to be attentive. Do not simultaneously roleplay other characters. Likewise, DMs are expected to provide their full attention to their games.
==- 13. **Do not desert a DM event.**
Only sign up for events that you are confident you can show up on time, and participate for the full duration. 

DMs are expected to report players failing to show up for games or disappearing part-way through their quests. Offenders may receive Demerit Points, receive the Deserter role (which will put them at the lowest priority when DMs choose participants for bounties), and have their rewards reduced or completely voided by their DM, in addition to other penalties associated with rule breaking.

Exceptions may be made if you have made an effort to communicate with your DM, and they have opted to make accommodations for you, particularly if the game duration continued beyond expectations.
==- 14. **If you die, die gracefully.**
We understand that character death may be upsetting, but that does not justify stirring up arguments and drama OOC. You can make your mark on history by leaving a record of your character’s downfall at [`#list-of-the-fallen`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/544159624790671391).

⚠️ *If your character dies during an encounter mid-bounty, do not delete your character from Avrae until you have been removed from initiative. This has resulted in problems with the initiative tracker.*
==- 15. **Intentional character death and self-harm are prohibited.**
If the staff come across evidence that you intentionally killed off your character for any reasons, your slot for that character will be locked for at least 1 month, likely in addition to other penalties associated with rule breaking.

If you wish to rebuild or retire your character, please follow the instructions in the ⁠rebuild-retire-log channel pins.
==- 16. **Signing up for DM events with pending rewards**
You may not sign a character up for a DM event until they receive all XP rewards from any previous DM events they participated in.
- Any pending RPXP claims are voided when accepted into a game and can then only be claimed if the game falls through last minute, or if the player retracts their sign up.

Pending magic items or gold are acceptable. However, if you receive them from a previous DM event after you have been already accepted for a new event, you must inform that DM. They will decide if you may use them.

### Joining a Roleplay

You can freely enter and join an ongoing roleplay in public channels such as [`#drunken-yeti-tavern`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/551901424276078602) or [`#honey-badger-café`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/562872331018698752).

For other channels, if there is an ongoing RP, there is always a possibility that the players are in a scene they have planned, or they prefer to RP 1v1. It is a good etiquette to ask in the corresponding ooc channel whether you may join the scene.

You are encouraged to utilize [`#rp-board`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/893946822404493392) for finding RP opportunities, or you are always welcome to walk into the tavern!

### Pinging

Before pinging anyone, please remember that different people have different thresholds for stress. To many people, a ping means urgent matters that need immediate attention, and they would not appreciate receiving pings for jokes or non-urgent matters.

An alternative method that is widely used on this server is using the Dusty bot's notifications function. There is a good chance that a staff member may have their preferred name dustied (added for being notified via Dusty), and a lot of players have their character names dustied as well. 

[A full list of Dusty bot's notification commands can be found here.](https://dustybot.info/reference#notifications)

Some players specify in their status/about me saying pings are welcome. 

💡 When in doubt, ask for their preferred method of notifications.

### Notifying Mods in case of Emergency

For exceptional issues that are time-sensitive, you may notify Mods. Some examples of such cases include:
- If there is a Bot raid and the Mods have not been notified yet, you may ping `@Mod`.
- If arguments between players are getting heated to the point it requires intervention, or if a Player vs Player (PvP) fight may be imminent, you may ping a Moderator who is online.

For general reports of rule-breaking behaviors, please react to the offending post with an ❗ `:exclamation:`. Further details can be found in ["How to Report Rule-Breaking"](/rules/#how-to-report-rule-breaking) section of [Server Rules](/rules/) (Discord: [`#rules`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/535362768379969547)).


### Receiving Pings from Staff

Staff may ping you in an official capacity when something directly concerns you. You are expected to respond or acknowledge as instructed. Here are some examples:

- DMs ping your Level role for games in the level range.
- DMs might ping you in [`#bounty-discussion`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/536011720553136138) regarding your game signups.
- DMs also ping you when you are accepted to a game. Many DMs choose to ping once again closer to the start of the game to ensure that the players are present (also referred to as a roll-call). Please respond or react promptly as instructed by the DM in order to secure your spot in the game.
<br><br>
- Mods may ping you in [`#lesser-courthouse`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/579940883202572308) for clarifications or warnings.
- Mods will ping you in [`#courthouse`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/576803952830578688) to issue Demerit Points or warnings for offenses.
- When interacting with a Moderator, please be polite and respectful. Please remember the following:
  - Moderators are volunteers who devote their time and effort in maintaining the server's community and environment.
  - No one mod is responsible for making a judgement call or handing out warnings.
  - If you wish to appeal the ruling, please message FanMail. We do this so that the Mod team can have a discussion on the issue, and the weight is not put on a single Moderator.
<br><br>
- NPC Masters will ping you in response to your posts in [`#black-market-registry`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/742720804525178900) or [`#npc-registry`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/545107769951518740). Please respond promptly so that the encounter can be scheduled at a mutually convenient time.

### Sending a Direct Message/Private Message (PM)

For reasons similar to Pings, please be aware that not everyone appreciates receiving PMs. The only exceptions are:
- You are a new member getting a help from a Welcomer via PMs.
- You have a report about an upper staff (Assistant and above) and sending the report to a Mod as a confidant. 

💡 When in doubt, ask for permission before sending a direct message.

For **questions**, it is always better to ask them in proper channels than in direct messages. This prevents misunderstandings, or answers being taken out of context, and it makes it easier for the staff to get a second opinion or help from other staff members. 

If you are unsure what the proper channel is for a certain question, please refer to the ["Guides and Q&A Channels by Topic"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506745916850176/965312269342875699) section of [`#channel-guide`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506745916850176), or simply ask them in [`#server-questions`](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584).

### Receiving Direct Messages/Private Messages (PM) from Staff

Staff may PM you in an official capacity when something directly concerns you. Please respond or acknowledge as instructed. Here are some examples:

- DMs might PM you to ask secret questions pertaining to a bounty.
- Mods might PM you when relating to an ongoing investigation.
- Assistants might PM you to move your characters in a DDB campaign link.
- NPC Masters might PM you to seek further details regarding your character for an encounter.
- Welcomers might PM you to assist with making your character.

### DM Events

The games on this server are **not** on-demand.

Our DMs run games on a strictly volunteer basis, so games happen whenever they're free, they have something prepared, and they want to DM. There is no set schedule and no way to know when a game which hasn't already been posted is upcoming.

Please remember that DMing requires time and energy, and life and work are often more than necessary to be prioritized before the hobbies.

### Varying Playstyles

In a regular campaign or a small server, the DM might interview players to ensure all players have similar playstyles. On this server however, we accept people from all backgrounds in order to be as accommodating as possible. This means you will have to make compromises when it comes to playing with other people with different styles from you.

In general, if you find that you do not mesh well with a certain player or character, you can either talk out these concerns with that player, or simply avoid them. However, if you feel like a rule has been breached or a line has been crossed, you should file a report to the FanMail bot and we will investigate accordingly.

### Miscellaneous Rulings in absence of DM

In unsanctioned fights, or spar sessions in arenas, some abilities may come into play which RAW requires a DM to choose, such as the Wild Magic Sorcerer: Wild Magic Surge/Tides of Chaos. 

By default, the players may decide among themselves by the Rule of Cool, depending on personal preference. 

However, if an agreement cannot be reached, then they may adopt the following optional ruling:
- In an RP channel, if an ability has the potential to affect commoners, then the ability does not activate.
- In an Arena channel, where collateral damage is alright, the ability activates.
- If an ability allows a DM to choose between rolling and picking, the player should roll.
- If ability only allows a DM to pick, the player gets to pick in lieu.
