## General Conduct

==- 1️️ **“I didn’t know that was the rule” doesn’t work here.**
Ignorance is not an excuse for rule-breaking. We expect you to read, understand, and agree to adhere to the rules.

**1.1. Read the channels containing rules covering specific topics.** Take your time to familiarize yourself with them.
- [Roleplay and DM events](/rp-rules/)
- [Character building](/character-building/cc-rules/)
- [RPXP](/start-playing/earn-xp/)
- [Rebuilding/Retiring (check the pins)](/records/rebuild/)
- [Lifestyle and Downtime](/downtime/lifestyle/)
- [Guilds, Housing, Market, etc](/advanced-play/)
- [PVP and Crime (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y1f2yFzFxE2PgpTzqJVG95mtMms3iG_RAVuah84LvI0/)

**1.2. Check the pins** of the channels before posting. They contain guidelines, instructions, or restrictions.
==- 2️ **This is a family-friendly server.**
When in doubt, err on the side of caution. The following are prohibited on this server:

- Swearing (both in and out of character) and evading the auto moderator by adding letters, misusing bots, using emojis, special fonts, etc.
- Roleplaying characters engaging in sexually suggestive, explicit, self-harming, suicidal, or cannibalistic behavior
- Gore
- Discussion of inappropriate topics such as sex and drugs
- Participating in, encouraging, discussing, or coercing users to participate in ERP (even in PMs) or other related behaviors, especially if unsolicited. 
- Posting images depicting or suggesting any of the above topics

⚠️ Users (and their parents/guardians) are however advised that DnD games will generally involve descriptions of violent acts.
==- 3️ **Be Excellent to Each Other.**

We reserve the right to remove you from the server if you are a nuisance, exhibit toxic behavior, or are otherwise ruining others' experiences on the server in any way. 

**3.1. Exercise common sense and social etiquette.**
You and your characters should not make others uncomfortable. This includes, but is not limited to: 

Name calling, excessive correcting, bullying, disrespect, hazing, harassment, racism, sexism, trolling, etc, whether taking place on the server or in PMs. 

**3.2. Don’t be a toxic presence.**
“Toxic presence” includes but not limited to:

- Acting immature, intentionally annoying or attention-seeking.
- Complaining about not getting into games, enough games, or rewards from games.
- Turning IC into OOC problems.
- Excessively bothering staff members for small or petty issues (this does not include asking for help from Welcomers as a newbie).

**3.3. Don’t stir up dissent or drama.**

This includes but is not limited to: 

Public accusations and complaints, slander, doxing, hostile/passive aggressive behavior, manipulation, etc. 

If you wish to report a problem, please see the [How to Report Rule-Breaking](/rules/#how-to-report-rule-breaking) section below.
==- 4️ **Use the appropriate channels.**

Use the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#channel-guide"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506745916850176) to find the right place to post. If you’re not sure where to do something, ask in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584).

Keep out-of-character discussions to OOC channels.
==- 5️ **Do Not Do the Staff's Jobs.**

Our staff members are given the instructions and authority to do what is necessary. Other members of the server should not try to do the staff’s job for them.

**5.1. Do not mini-mod.**
If you see someone breaking the rules, alert the staff using the guidelines below, rather than interfering.

**5.2. Do not act as a backseat DM without permission.**
You may point out a rule or two if it seems your DM has overlooked them, but please do not take it upon yourself to ensure all other players are doing things to the letter. 

Each DM may have a different threshold of what is considered as backseat DMing. The polite approach is to first ask if the DM would appreciate assistance or not.

**5.3. Do not reply to queries in FAQ channels.**
==- 6️ **Do not interfere with disciplinary actions in `#courthouse` or `#lesser-courthouse`.**

Do not write messages in those channels unless you’ve been specifically called upon by a staff member to do so, or you are self-reporting issues. 

If you have something to add to the discussion, send a message to the `@-FanMail-` bot.
==- 7️ **All forms of advertising are prohibited.**

This includes advertisement for art commissions. The only exceptions are officially sanctioned material, such as partner servers. The guidelines for establishing server partnership are pinned in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#partner-servers"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/529249355748605952).

For inquiries involving paid promotions and/or giveaways, please message `@-FanMail-`.
==- 8️ **Refrain from discussing divisive topics.**
This server is not an appropriate place for discussing divisive topics, such as politics, religion, and current world events/issues.
==- 9️ **Do not ping roles or high-ranking staff members without explicit permission.**
If you need help:
- Ask for help in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584). You will get an answer from a staff member, or be redirected to the right channel for further inquiries.
- You may contact Welcomers via direct messages to get help with getting started on this server.
- If you have a private or sensitive matter to discuss that you would prefer to avoid getting other staff involved with, send a private message to one of our Admin, Senior, or Mentor staff.
==- 1️️0️ **This server does not endorse or allow discussion of piracy.**
This includes posting illegally shared content/documents, and links to websites that offer them.

Instead, you are invited to make use of the server's DnDBeyond content sharing links (requested via [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#ddb-link-request"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/756319993616138310)), look it up on google, Roll20's compendium, or consider purchasing your own hardcopy of source materials.
==- 1️️1️ **Multi-accounting is not permitted.**
Especially for the purposes of ban evasion or stat rerolling.
==- 1️️2️ **Comply with Staff's Requests.**
If a staff member, in an official capacity, asks you to either do or stop something, you are expected to comply.

If you have an issue with such a request, again you may raise the matter by sending a message to `@-FanMail-`, or by messaging a higher ranking staff member.
==- 1️️3️ **This is an English-speaking server.**

We disallow discussions in other languages due to difficulties in moderating, and so that everyone can understand each other.
==- 1️️4️ **Use the proper nickname format.**
Newbies are expected to have their nicknames in the following format at all times:<br>
 `Name of Character (Race Class).`

Active Players have more liberty with styling their nicknames. However, while participating in a DM event, they should also adopt the proper nickname format.
==- 1️️5️ **No posting or discussion of AI art.**
Do not post, discuss, or promote AI art on the server, especially in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#arts"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/522427573746008064). Users who state their portraits are AI generated must change them.
==- 1️️6️ **No Spamming.**
Do not spam, which includes headers, images, gifs, etc.

## What Happens When a Rule is Broken?

When a user breaks a rule, they may be warned, receive Demerit Points (DP), banned, or otherwise penalized depending on the severity of the offense, at the discretion of the moderator team.

### Lesser Courthouse
A user may be pinged in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#lesser-courthouse"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/579940883202572308) for minor mistakes or first time offenses. Please respond to the ping, and correct mistakes accordingly.

### Demerit Point System
For severe offenses, the offending user is summoned to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#courthouse"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/576803952830578688) and be reminded of the rules. One or more Demerit Points (DP) may be assigned to the user. The user is then informed how many total active DPs they have. 

The penalties associated with Demerit Points are as follows:

- **1 DP**: Warning<br>
- **2 DP**: 1 Week event lock AND RP lock. You will not be permitted to participate in any RP channels or games. This comes into effect directly after the Courthouse.<br>
- **3 DP**: Ban

Demerit Points expire over time, but to discourage intentionally-timed repeated offenses, their expiry dates are only known to moderators, and a permanent record of them is kept in private. 

You are advised to avoid accumulating demerits at all costs, especially if you have aspirations to one day join the staff team. They will be taken into consideration when reviewing staff applications.

### Ban Appeal

It is possible to appeal for the ban via submitting [the following form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOPLdQJYMcN9wW94sn5LNGzG3xKT9CG3H5ZWr-hQkNXHBSww/viewform). Please note that submitting the form does not guarantee a successful appeal.


## How to Report Rule-Breaking

For problematic posts that require immediate attention, please react to the post with an ❗`:exclamation:`. 
- This will anonymously beam the message to a private mod channel, removing your reaction.
- Moderators will not know who reported the message, only the details of the flagged post (original poster, message contents, & date/time).
- You will receive a DM to confirm that your report has been received.
- See the below screenshot for how your report will appear to the Mods:

### Whistleblowing
If you think someone could be breaking the rules and wish to report it, you can PM
-  `@-FanMail-`, if it involves another player
- A Moderator, if it involves a staff member
- or an Admin, if it involves a mod or mentor

All information will be kept confidential. Your efforts will be highly appreciated by the mod team and will keep the server a safe and fair place.

### Self Report
If you discover that you have made a mistake, you may self report to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#self-reports"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/1019512399314821140). Please note that this does not guarantee leniency but will increase its likelihood.
