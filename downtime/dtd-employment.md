## Part-Time Work (PTW) üí∞

*A part time job offers the promise of modest but consistent pay.*

- In order to do the Part-Time Work DTD, you need to first find the employer using [Find DTD](/downtime/dtd/#find).
- The starting wage for all PTW is **4gp** per day. You still get paid whether or not you pass the check, unless the output states otherwise.
- If you are using a tool for PTW, make sure to set up the proficiency with `!tool` alias. You can find the information under [Tool Checks](/downtime/dtd-employment/#tool-checks)

#### Raises and Pay Cuts
> If you consistently perform well at your job with successful checks, you may be given a raise. Likewise, failing the checks may result in a pay cut. If your pay drops to zero or you fail five checks in a week, you are fired and need to find a new job.
> 
> The maximum wage per day with PTW is 6gp. Successful checks for a full week gives a one time bonus of extra 5gp.

## High-Risk Work (HRW) üí∞

*"High risk, high reward."*

*Some jobs, such as working for the local militia as a guard, involve risks. These jobs require multiple skills and come with a risk of injury for each failed check. However, they pay more, and are more forgiving when things go wrong.*

- In order to do the High-Risk Work DTD, you need to first find the employer using [Find DTD](/downtime/dtd/#find).
- The starting wage for all HRW is **6gp** per day. You still get paid whether or not you pass the check, unless the output states otherwise.

#### Raises and Pay Cuts
> If you consistently perform well at your job with successful checks, you may be given a raise. The maximum wage per day with HRW is 10gp.
> 
> Failing checks may result in a pay cut, or you may get fired. You can find out the details in the output of the `hrw` command.
