## D&D 5e Only

Currently, **we only play D&D 5e** (aka D&D 2014) in this server. Our stance on D&D 5.5e/2024 is still undecided and is de facto banned until we come to a decision. [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="You can read more about our adoption plan here."](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/528882919658356753/1280268751639543949)

In light of Avrae updating to include the new 2024 PHB content, we would like to tentatively inform everyone that until a decision has been made on how to move forward with the new ruleset, **we will still be using the 2014 versions of spells/feats/classes/etc.**

:::demo
The new versions of these are either tagged with "(free-rules)" or "(PHB-2024)". Ensure **NOT** to select these options when prompted, either through casting or look-up, especially during official games done on the server. Please take care to remember this distinction.

==- :beginner: **Introduction to Dungeons & Dragons 5e**
The best way of getting to know D&D is by reading the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Basic Rules"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules).

#### Part 1: Creating a Character
> - Simply start from **Chapter 1: "Step-By-Step Characters"**. This section goes hand-in-and with [the above steps](/character-building/new-to-dnd/#dd-beyond-character-builder) and will help you make your first DnD character. 
> - Chapter 2-5 describes each details of a character more in depth.
> - Chapter 6 will become more relevant later in the game as you level up.

#### Part 2: Playing the Game
> - **Chapter 7: Using Ability Score** describes how the ability scores (stats) are used in the game.
> - Chapter 8 is more relevant for playing campaigns, less so on this server.
> - Make sure to look over **Chapter 9: Combat** before attending a DM event.
>   - Appendix A: Conditions often comes handy during a game.

#### Part 3: The Rules of Magic

> - **Chapter 10: Spellcasting** describes rules around spellcasting in D&D. If your character is a spellcaster, this section of the rules is relevant to you.
> - Chapter 11 lists available spells for each class, as well as full description of the spells.

You can also find the full PDF version of the Basic Rules [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf).

## Player Character Rules

- Your characters start at **Level 1**.
- You are **not** allowed to possess any magic items starting out.

For information on allowed/banned material as well as allowed UA and homebrew options, please have a look at [Character Creation Rules](/character-building/cc-rules/).

==- **Rules for Multiple Characters**
> - You start with **2 character slots** on this server. You can gain extra character slots by becoming a [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Patron"](https://www.patreon.com/Dndworld) or taking on certain staff roles.
> - You may make your additional characters any time, following the same procedure as your first character. 

> - You cannot sign up for, or go on the same quest with both characters, as per [Roleplay Rules 11](/rp-rules/). 
> - If you are roleplaying more than one character at the same time, you can only gain RPXP for one of them during that period.
> 
> - Your characters cannot be in the same guild.
> - Your characters cannot benefit from each other's presence, e.g. they cannot give each other items or gold.

### Already Have a Character?

==- **Transferring Characters from Other Servers/Campaigns**
You cannot transfer characters from other places. However, you can create a version of them in this server following the same creation process as any other new characters.
==- **:warning: Returning Players/Inactivity**
Whether you leave the server and return after some period of time, or you have been inactive on the server for some time, your characters do **not** automatically reset. You must keep all rolled results, as well as the characters created before the leave or inactivity. 

### Invalid Stats Rebuild
If you have a roll made before 11 August 2020, you may reroll for it provided you lack one of the following:
- 70 or above in total stats
- At least one 14 or above
- Separate stat of at least one 15 or above

To reroll, please declare which character you are rerolling for, then run `!generate` ONCE in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#official-character-rolls"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/513963351567499264). You may choose between your new and previous roll:
- To use your new roll, submit the [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="Invalid Stats rebuild form"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946/941343439428145223) in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rebuild-retire-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946) and wait for it to be processed.
- To keep your previous roll, react ‚ùå on the new roll.

### Fresh Start
- In case you have been away for a significant amount of time, we allow you to mass retire all of your characters. In this case only one of them is eligible for the Cushion Rule. You are not required to do Fresh Start if you have been away, but if you choose to do fresh start, it applies to all characters you had.
- Fresh Start is approved on a case-by-case basis. Please fill in the following form and send it to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rebuild-retire-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946) and wait for the request to be reviewed.
