## Change Your Server Nickname
Change your Server Nickname to **`<Name of Character> (<Race> <Class>)`**.

> Examples:
> - Myrdin (Halfling Ranger) 
> - Panadol (Drow Warlock)

## Upload Your Character Sheet
- Click "Share" button in the header of your character sheet to get the shareable link. 
- In [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), replace the `<link>` with the link of your character sheet.

```
!import <link>
```

If you have used standard array or point buy, declare so after you upload your sheet. 

You DO NOT need to wait for your sheet to be approved.

Once you've uploaded your sheet to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#character-sheets"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/512872392377499661), you will be automatically granted **Newbie** and **Level 1** roles, and the rest of the server should now be visible. If for some reason the bot fails, send a message to [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-questions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/546725434608451584), and a staff member will grant you the roles.

### Character Creation Phase

After you create your character and before the character attends a DM event, the character is considered to be in the character creation phase. During this time, you may change parts of the character as many times as you want. Following rules apply:

> - You must keep all rolled results. If you have rolled the stats, you cannot switch back to Standard Array or Point Buy.
> - If you chose Standard Array or Point buy as the Ability Score generation method, you may switch to rolling for stats. Please note, once you rolled the stats, you must use them.
> - You may not switch between choosing starting equipment and rolling for gold.
> - You may not reroll stats / gold / hp.

> - If any of the starting equipment were sold and you need to switch them, retcon the transaction before doing so.
> - Keep RPXP and Experience counter values.

> - You are still in the character creation phase after gaining XP from Combat Training DTD, an approved RPXP claim, or Avrae Tutorial XP.

!!!warning 
Once your character participates in a DM event, all rebuilds must be submitted for review in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#rebuild-retire-log"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/542953099560615946), following the rules in the pin.

==- :beginner: New to D&D?
Don't roll for HP. Sticking to fixed HP is a safer option.

For your ASI, you generally want to max out your primary stat. Some people prefer doing that with their later ASIs to get a feat earlier, but for now, putting your first ASI into your primary stat is a safe choice.

Save multiclassing for when you are more experienced. Putting together a level plan that is both better than monoclass and fun to play throughout requires a bit of experience and planning. For now, it is best to just get used to the game.

Before you hit Level 5, consider whether you would like to Rebuild your character before their build is locked in. You can avoid participating in games until you are sure, maybe even start building your second character!
