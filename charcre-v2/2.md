This channel is a "Quick Start" guide for newcomers to the server.

- World setting and server info: [About Us](/)
- If you need help or have questions about getting started on the server, please reach out to `#beginner-help`! 
- If you have any other questions, please reach out to `#server-questions`!

This page will walk you through the content that is allowed on this server, as well as any other character creation rules and technical stuff you should know about. It is written with players of all experience levels in mind, but watch out for these icons:
- :beginner: **New to D&D?** Open these panels if you would like to more specific newbie-friendly steps and advice.
- :zap: **Quick Start**. Open these panels for a preset option (or two) that is widely-supported and allowed in this server. (Good if you want to start playing ASAP or just a starting place to explore and compare options.)

## Character Sheet Options
:::
> You must use a sheet compatible with **Avrae** Discord bot. The following are all free to use. Your options are:
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**D&D Beyond**"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) :beginner: **Best for newbies**
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**GSheet**"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DtJ9AYC_BWUuvP85UqVBBscQO8DhZF8ArAdZnjUO0WM/) (DW version)
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**DiceCloud v1**"](https://v1.dicecloud.com/)
> - [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="**DiceCloud v2**"](https://dicecloud.com/)

> - DiceCloud and GSheet are best for homebrew. DiceCloud takes some learning, so it is recommended for more experienced players.
> - GSheet is the closest to a paper sheet/fillable PDF, so if you are used to those methods, you may find GSheet the easiest.
> - Mythweavers, character sheet apps, and PDFs are not compatible with Avrae.

If you are using D&D Beyond, these options will be marked with the `[Legacy]` tag.
!!!

!!! When a new official material is published
it first needs to be reviewed by our Homebrewer team. The new material is considered **banned** until the review process is complete. The list of the approved and denied materials will be posted to `#changelog`, followed by the update on this channel.
!!!

> #### Disallowed Books
> - Explorer's Guide to Wildemount

> - UA that gets officially released or revisited later in another UA is banned.
> - Any UA content that hasn't been vetted for approval yet isn't allowed. Therefore, if it is not in the approved UA section, it is not allowed.

> #### Homebrew Rules
> - You cannot multiclass with Homebrew and UA classes/subclasses due to balance reasons.
> - If you plan on using Homebrew or UA content, we highly recommend you to use GSheet or DiceCloud sheets due to various limitations of D&D Beyond's Homebrew system.

### Character Details

**Name**
> - Your nickname, character name, as well as username must be easily pingable by the staff members and not something with over repetition of characters (e.g. Caaaaaallum), key-smashes (e.g. jahfjbqwubwqu), difficult to search (e.g. "Copy" or "Backup" as a name), use special font, etc. 
> - Try not to double up on character names with an Active Player to minimize confusion. Use the Discord search function to see if someone else has a similar or especially the exact same name, and preferably use a different one.

**Age**
> - You are not allowed to create characters younger than adolescence, using the guidelines the below chart.
> - You also may not play a character who behaves drastically younger than their actual age, i.e. overtly childish behavior.

#### Background
> Backgrounds are different but closely linked to backstories. Your background gives your character certain abilities and special features depending on how they spent their lives before becoming an adventurer.
> Your background likely will not (and does not have to) perfectly represent your backstory. Choose one that represents the most important aspect in your backstory, the most backstory elements, and/or simply offers the set of proficiencies you like most.
> - For information on each background, see [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/backgrounds).

#### Others
> The rest are optional and are for adding personality and different aspects to your character. Bring them to life! The personality traits, characteristics, etc. lists are providing you with examples. You do not need to choose from the tables. 
> - Faith: Check out ⁠pantheon for the gods of Icris. 
> - Lifestyle: This is handled in the DW server, not in D&D Beyond. Continue following the Getting Started guides to learn more.

> - Any subclasses the source books determine as restricted to certain races, such as the Battlerager barbarian, are available for all races to use. However, feats that are restricted to certain races can still only be used by those races as stated in the source books.

> For the full list of allowed and disallowed official races, please refer to the following doc. For races with multiple versions, please make sure you are using a version that is allowed.

==- :beginner:  New to D&D?
> Races refer to human, elves, dwarves, etc. Each race can provide some mechanical benefit to your character in game, such as stats, traits, or even spells! For approved/disapproved materials, see [Character Creation Rules](/character-building/cc-rules/).
> - More extensive descriptions on races can be found [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="here"](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races)

> However, as we are not using the WOTC world, take their descriptions and lore with a grain of salt, e.g. Tieflings are pretty common in the server so they do not suffer as much discrimination as described.

## Ability Scores
:::

> You may use Standard Array / Point Buy / Rolling for the character stats.

### Stats
> - For rolling, use `!rollstats` in `#official-character-rolls`.
> 
> You are only permitted one roll per character, and the command will give you stats that are to our server's minimum standard.
> 
> !!!warning
> Do not roll stats on D&D Beyond! You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling.

> 
> - You cannot use Standard Array/Point Buy after rolling.

### :warning: Rolling for Stats/HP/Gold

> - It is entirely **optional** to roll for stats/gold/hp. However, once you have made the rolls, you must use the rolled results.

#### Ability Scores Generation Methods

==- :zap: Quick Start

Go to `#official-character-rolls` and use `!rollstats`. Take your six stats and order them from highest to lowest.

Find your class's primary stat, and put your highest stat there. If you have two, pick either one if it lists them with "or", else pick the first one.

For your second highest stat, put it in your "&" primary stat if you have one, or else put it in Constitution if your primary stat is Stre
If your class has two, put it in the first.

If your primary stat is Strength or Dexterity, put your second highest stat on Constitution.

If not, put your second highest stat on Dexterity, then your third highest in Constitution.
