## Background and Resources

The site is built using Retype, but for most contributors, this simply means the files are in Markdown (the same markup language Discord uses for formatting messages).

- [FYI page](/docs/dev-fyi/) - useful tips and copypasta compiled from developing the site
- [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Retype documentation"](https://retype.com/) - Retype components and site configuration
- [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Tailwind documentation"](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS utilities used by Retype for styling (in case you go inspecting the site code)

## Tutorials

Overall, with Git and GitHub, your changes should be committed (saved) to your fork (clone of the repository), and then you should make a Pull Request from your fork (suggest the changes) to this repository. Each time you commit, you should also describe the change in a message. Other nuances will be described below where relevant.

- [Developing on GitHub](/docs/github-dev/) has fewer technical requirements. Recommended if this is your first time and you are only changing the text content.
- [Developing from your machine](/docs/local-dev/) has more technical requirements, but will let you preview your changes and perform different changes.
