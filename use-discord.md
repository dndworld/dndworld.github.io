> - **To find a character's transactions**:  `in:#transaction-log <character name>` (replace `<character name>`, incl. `<>`)

### How to Link a Discord Message
Follow [this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/714348/how-to-enable-or-disable-developer-mode-on-discord/), but look for the `Copy Message Link` option, not the `Copy ID` option.

React with a 🔔 in following circumstances:

- React to your own question if it got buried in the FAQ section (For example, if questions below yours have already been answered AND it has been at least 10 minutes since the last staff activity in that channel).

- React to another member's question that is in a **non**-FAQ channel
