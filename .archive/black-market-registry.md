## Etiquette

*Please follow these guidelines, or your request will be denied:*
- **Each player may only have one unresolved registry at a time.**
- **Registries may be edited until a shopkeeper reacts with <img class="emoji" src="/images/emoji-pending.webp"> on it. Afterwards, the registry may no longer be edited.**
- Use the [!badge icon="link-external" variant="info" text="Black Market Bin"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166Do3cLcg_NYRZqSaAN34LQxY9C5xda5WDb9kYezJMM/) or [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#figaros-reflavor-shop"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/555548772545855508) when applicable.
- List the items you are trading with clearly. Any homebrew items traded in should be linked or spelled out.
 - **Consumables are unable to be traded.**
- You may make thematic requests/give direction on what you would like the item to do, but specific mechanical changes, values and stat blocks are not possible.
- Ensure you have substantial amounts of gold, Black Marks and/or valuable items that can be traded. Uncommons start at several hundred gp. See the Black Market Bin for reference.
- Be clear with your request, don’t make the Shopkeeper guess what you want.
  - Bad: Looking for a custom item that fits my character’s class
  - Better: Looking for a shield that offers some mobility options
  - Best: Looking for a flail that is effective against undead

## Note on Upgrades

- All item upgrades improve its rarity by at least one Tier. (e.g. Uncommon to Rare)
- Upgrades to existing magic items are on a case-by-case basis. It may be incredibly costly if not impossible due to an item's design and/or limitation of a single attunement slot.

### Items/Services Not Obtainable through Registry

- Homebrew cursed items
- Upgrades within the same rarity (e.g. upgrading an Uncommon to a better Uncommon)
- Changing an official item’s “body slot” (e.g. a helmet cannot be turned into a ring)
- Legendary items, including upgrades from Very Rare items
- Tomes, Manuals, or other items that permanently increase ability scores.
- Certain official items, at shopkeeper's discretion
- Combining attuned items
