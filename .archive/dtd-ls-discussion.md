## What to Roll for Tool Checks at your Job

*Note that a player may use a different stat for a check if they can make a convincing case for how they intend to use the tools with that stat.* 

*__You may also search for a job that does not require tools__, in which case you will be assigned a stat based on what makes sense for the job. If you wish to find a job that utilizes a specific skill or stat, try to be specific in your search description for the Find DTD.*

==- "What locations in Snowhaven can I look for X?"

[The map in About Us](/#snowhaven-nanam) has more than enough locations pinned, use caution and common sense
==- "Is there a maximum wage?"
Yes, 6gp for PTW and 10gp for HRW.
==- What if my and other players' characters are living together?
Each of you still have your individual lifestyle expenses. You can combine payments and say, "I want a room for two", if you want, but basically you end up paying the same amount.

If you are all tenants in the same House, you add to the House's taxes each week you do LS/DTD. It is up to the houseowner and tenants to agree on a rental plan.
