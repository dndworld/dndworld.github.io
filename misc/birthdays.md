## Guidelines for Redeeming Birthday Items

- Enter your birthday in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#birthdays"](https://discordapp.com/channels/512870694883950598/534369999909814282) using this command: `/birthday set Day-Month` e.g. `/birthday set 8-Sep`. 
- The magic item must be for cosmetic use only and be of Common rarity; please see the guidelines below for more info.
- You may request homebrew items, subject to approval
- You have 1 week before and after your birthday to claim your item
- Your birthday must be registered in the bot to qualify for the item

If you leave and return to the server, your information will still be saved within the bot. 

To apply for your item, PM the following form to `@FanMail`:
``` Birthday Item Request Form
Owned by: [Character] - DiscordID
Item: [Name of Item]
Obtained: [Date]
Effect: [Description]
Obtained through: Birthday Gift
```

## Birthday Item Guidelines

You may request a homebrew item for your birthday, which needs to satisfy the following requirements and must be approved via `@FanMail`.

1. It must be of Common rarity
2. It cannot have or be used for any mechanical benefit
3. No magic weapons (e.g. Moontouched Swords, Staff of Flowers); items which could double as such (i.e. staffs) must be made into non-weapons
4. No tattoos
5. If you wish for a magic version of an existing item (i.e. Smoldering Breastplate) you must already own the base version of the item
6. No upgrades to magic items, including past birthday items (magic items that interact with other magic items or features are fine)

Alternatively, you may choose from the following list. You still need to wait for a FanMail confirmation before adding it to the inventory.
