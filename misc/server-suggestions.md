Suggestions for improvements to the server can be submitted in [!badge icon="/images/discord-mark-blue.svg" variant="info" text="#server-suggestions"](https://discord.com/channels/512870694883950598/537506014883217419) for review by the management team. At the end of every quarter, Mentors, Seniors, and Admins meet to vote on new suggestions. They are then implemented progressively by Assistants or other departments.

Most projects take about three months to complete, while complex ones can take between six months to a year. As staff availability is finite, resources are budgeted by the priority of a project.

The `@Active Player` role is required to make suggestions.

## Common Suggestions that have been Rejected

Following suggestions have been submitted multiple times, gone through reviews and been rejected. Please do not re-submit these suggestions.

- **No suggestions that involve adding more roles**<br>We already have a significant amount of roles and adding more contributes to role bloat

- **Automated/semi-automatic combat**<br>This is too much like a video game and not a TTRPG

- **Multi-level dungeons in Snowhaven for PCs to explore**<br>Does not fit within canon lore

- **New water related places e.g. another lake, river, swimming pool, hot spring, etc.**<br>People tend to do non-PG things when they lose a layer of clothing

- **Monthly/Biweekly events**<br>We already have holidays events, and each event requires a lot of planning and effort (typically prep starts 3 weeks beforehand and lasts throughout the entire event) hence we cannot keep up systematic events.

- **Any suggestion relating or boiling down to "more games" or "more staff"**<br>This falls under Rule 4 of Suggestions, in that it is unfeasible as it is out of our control

## Common Reasons Why Suggestions Are Denied

*A high percentage of suggestions do not end up being approved. These suggestions are not technically against the rules, but are usually denied because of one or more of these reasons. This post is meant to encourage petitioners to fine tune their suggestions so it stands a higher chance of getting approved.*

- **The suggestion lacks a feasible solution**<br>Factors that are out of our control such as timezones, Discord limitations, bot limitations, availability limitations all fall into this category. Examples include more staff, more games, more events, etc.

- **The suggestion does not fit the design of the server**<br>An unchangeable aspect is that the server is a West Marches/Living World server. Suggestions that rely on elements that are an antithesis to the server's design fall into this category, such as LFG systems, fixed party/campaign systems, and hobby discussion channels.

- **The suggestion lacks crucial information**<br>Often coming in the form of suggestions that lack solutions, these suggestions cannot or are difficult to be understood. A substantial suggestion must have a clear intent, purpose, and implementation.

- **The suggestion is too long**<br>On the flip side, a suggestion can be too long, often overloaded with multiple suggestions in one post or very complicated solutions, which makes them too wordy and difficult to read. 

- **The suggestion is unbalanced**<br>There is simply too much room for exploitation, and the amount of work required to rebalance it is simply not worth it.

- **The suggestion takes too much effort for little payoff**<br>Sometimes a suggestion fits all the criteria and is really great, but simply cannot be done because the amount of time and energy needed is not worth the potential payoff. Suggestions that involve overhauling major systems in order to fix a small exploit/detail falls under this category.
